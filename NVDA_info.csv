NVIDIA Brings GeForce RTX 4080 Performance to GeForce NOW
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced GeForce NOW™ is going beyond fast, delivering GeForce RTX™ 4080-class gaming to billions of devices — available exclusively in the new, high-performance Ultimate membership tier.
Powered by the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, upgraded GeForce NOW RTX 4080 SuperPODs will deliver over 64 teraflops of graphics horsepower to an individual user, which is more than 5x that of an Xbox Series X and nearly 1.75x over the previous-generation SuperPODs.
The GeForce NOW Ultimate membership raises the bar on cloud gaming, bringing it closer than ever to a local gaming experience. With GeForce RTX 4080 performance, Ultimate members will be the first to experience true PC gaming — streaming at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3, in hit games like Portal With RTX. With the addition of NVIDIA Reflex, GeForce NOW achieves click-to-pixel latency below 40 milliseconds — another first in cloud gaming.
“NVIDIA’s Ada architecture is a big leap in graphics quality, and through GeForce NOW we’re streaming an RTX 4080 experience to more devices and more gamers than ever,” said Jeff Fisher, senior vice president of GeForce at NVIDIA. “GeForce NOW Ultimate members will have the technology and the performance to experience even the most demanding games in their full ray-traced glory.”
Current GeForce NOW RTX 3080 members will be upgraded immediately to Ultimate memberships and be among the first to experience the full benefits of GeForce RTX 4080 performance in the cloud when the servers start rolling out later this month.
RTX Technologies to the Cloud
NVIDIA RTX technologies introduced with the Ultimate membership are lifting cloud gaming to new heights. NVIDIA Reflex 240-fps mode brings frame-pacing technology to the cloud, which helps streamline the execution of game simulation, rendering and encoding on the server. When paired with an NVIDIA G-SYNC® monitor, GeForce NOW will vary the streaming rate to the client for the first time, delivering smooth and instantaneous frame updates to client screens on Reflex-enabled games — further driving down total latency.
Next-generation RTX technologies coming to GeForce NOW include full ray tracing and DLSS 3 — introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series launch. They deliver beautiful, cinematic-quality graphics and use AI to keep frame rates smooth.
The Ultimate Benefits
GeForce NOW Ultimate members are set to receive three major streaming upgrades. The new SuperPODs are capable of rendering and streaming at up to 240 fps. Paired with NVIDIA Reflex, members’ game play will feel as if it is on a desktop PC.
4K gaming goes from fast to beyond fast with an upgrade from 60 fps to 120 fps, while ultrawide monitors will be supported for the first time, at up to 3,840 x 1,600 resolution, including many popular variants such as 3440 x 1440 and 2560 x 1080.
Ultimate members can enjoy longer streaming sessions, fastest access to the highest-performance cloud gaming servers and game settings that persist from session to session.
It’s Time to Play the Game
GeForce NOW recently eclipsed the 1,500 game milestone — with mega-hits from top publishers like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, popular PC indie titles like Valheim and Rust, and over 100 of the biggest free-to-play games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact. New games are released every GFN Thursday, and new features like Ubisoft account syncing bring members into their games instantly. Games are available from the biggest PC game stores, including Steam, Epic, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.
Members will be able to stream some of the biggest upcoming PC game launches on the service, starting with Portal With RTX later this week. Relive the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portal reimagined with full ray tracing and higher frame rates with DLSS 3, streaming from the cloud.
Ultimate members will see performance multiply with DLSS 3 for Atomic Heart, from Mundfish and Focus Entertainment. FNTASTIC and MyTona’s The Day Before launches later this year, accelerated by DLSS 3, and with a detailed world enhanced with ray-traced reflections. Stream with, or against, friends with the realistic physics engine in Party Animals from Recreate Games and Source Technology.
The GeForce NOW catalog features many of the most popular PC games, including recent day-and-date releases of Marvel’s Midnight Suns, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Next-Gen Update, as well as massive, free-to-play titles like Destiny 2, Lost Ark and Apex Legends.
Pricing and Availability
The GeForce NOW Ultimate membership is available for new user sign-ups today, at $19.99 per month or $99.99 for six months. GeForce RTX 3080 members’ accounts have already been converted to the new membership at their current pricing. Upgraded GeForce RTX 4080 performance streaming from the new SuperPODs will be available in North America and Europe starting later this month, with continued rollout over the months to follow. Quantities are limited.
New AT&T Fiber customers, and new or existing AT&T 5G customers on an eligible 5G rate plan, can get a complimentary six-month Ultimate membership. Visit AT&T Gaming for more details.
Priority memberships remain available starting at $9.99 per month or $49.99 for six months. These members get access to premium rigs that turn RTX ON, extended session lengths and faster access to gaming servers.

Why AMD, Intel, and Nvidia Stocks Popped Monday
Certain semiconductor stocks do look attractive at their present prices. Intel stock, for example, costs less than 9 times trailing earnings currently. AMD and Nvidia, at 39 times and 60 times trailing earnings, respectively, may not be objectively cheap, but they are at least about 50% cheap-er than what they were selling for a year ago.

Why Salesforce Stock Was Gaining Today
Shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) were moving higher Monday on reports that management might institute another round of layoffs beyond the one it announced last week, when it said it was cutting roughly 10% of its staff, or 8,000 employees. At an all-hands meeting on Thursday following that initial round of job cuts, CEO Marc Benioff seemed to suggest that more reductions could be coming. Benioff noted that about 95% of the company's deals come from half of its account executives, implying that there's a lot of wasteful spending at the company or underperformance among its sales force.

‘Too Cheap to Ignore’: J.P. Morgan Says These 2 Stocks Could Rebound in 2023
We are yet to find out what lies in store for the stock market in 2023. However, we do know that the previous year was one of the worst ever, with the S&P 500 putting in its 7th most abject annual performance since 1929. Whichever way you look at it, then, most investors did not enjoy the past 12 months’ market action. One positive takeaway, however, is that the overall bearish trend has driven share prices down across the board and that has left some stocks at levels that are now just too cheap

While the day-to-day machinations of the financial markets have left many investors feeling discouraged lately, stocks can still be a fantastic way to build and sustain wealth over a period of many years. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is at the forefront of cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, a space on track to eclipse $17 billion by the end of the decade. Therapeutic drugs designed to target the root cause of CF and enhance a patient's quality of life, known as CFTR modulators, remain key to managing the disease for thousands of people globally.",IIROC Trading Resumption - TFM,148.59,156.28,159.09,1,2023,9

“They have a little bit more of a long-run horizon. They also tend to lean towards some of the more growth-oriented technology names,” said TD Ameritrade’s head trading strategist Shawn Cruz.
“They might be one of the first client bases that are willing to step in and use some of these pullbacks as buying opportunities.”
Data compiled by the brokerage firm shows recent investor behavior among its clients. TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index in December came in at 4.7, unchanged from the previous month. Clients ended the year as net sellers of equities overall but bought into some of the names that have gotten beaten up through 2022.
“We saw electric vehicles like Tesla (TSLA), Rivian (RIVN), get some interest. We also saw some of the more popular tech names that have really been getting hit really hard like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN).”
Cruz also noted “semiconductors is becoming a little bit more of a stock pickers' market.”
He said investors have been buying Intel (INTC), while unloading names like Nvidia (NVDA). Traders also used the month of December to offload some energy names amid fluctuating oil prices.
“I do expect that to be a little bit more of a volatile month per month industry — when you look at energy names as far as what is being bought and sold,” said Cruz.

NVDA,2023-01-10 12:14:35,"The SoftBank-owned chip designer is set to return to public markets this year, but listing in New York or London won't change the difficulties ahead.","ARM is preparing for an IPO in 2023 that couldn't come at a more tricky time.
The SoftBank-owned chip designer will enter the market during a brutal downturn.
The chip sector has particularly suffered as it continues to reckon with supply chain issues.
The listing of Arm on the stock exchange in 2023 is set to be one of the year's standout IPOs – but the timing for a blockbuster public market entry couldn't be worse.
The UK chip designer, bought by SoftBank in 2016 for $32 billion, is being prepared for a return to the public markets this year by the Japanese conglomerate's CEO Masayoshi Son in the midst of one of the most brutal market downturns in recent decades.
An attempt by US chip giant Nvidia to buy Arm for $40 billion fell flat last year amid intense regulatory scrutiny. This pushed SoftBank to reposition Arm for the public markets as the Japanese firm seeks to generate profits from assets that can offset losses in its venture capital business.
Arm's re-listing isn't quite as clear-cut as SoftBank would like, with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak upping efforts in December for a dual-listing involving London, according to the Financial Times. This triggered a tug-of-war with the US over a company considered the crown jewel of UK tech.
But it's a battle whose outcome is likely to prove futile either way for Arm, a chip firm behind proprietary designs that find themselves in the world's leading smartphones and cars, with its fortunes even less clear-cut in a future fraught with risk.
Squashed investor appetite for speculative tech firms and a brutal downturn for the chip sector means SoftBank's attempt to steam ahead with listing Arm (to support its own balance sheet woes) in 2023 could prove to be more turbulent than it needs to be.
The IPO door remains (mostly) shut
Few other privately held tech companies itching for a public listing are rushing to market at a time when the IPO window appears all but shut.
Figures from EY suggest that after a record year of listings in 2021, last year's IPO market went into reverse mode. Deal volumes fell 45% and proceeds dropped by 61% in the face of reduced appetite for more speculative stocks against a backdrop of soaring interest rates.
There is no sign of that trend changing in 2023.
On Saturday, after it emerged that fintech giant Ant Financial would no longer be under the control of Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, the company confirmed to Reuters that it had no plans to carry out an IPO.
Its previous plans to raise $37 billion in an IPO in late 2020 fell over after Chinese regulators introduced new lending rules. Any future plans for an IPO in the near-term seem all but diminished as investors have become even more cautious around China's creeping involvement in markets that are at their most volatile in more than a decade.
Others are biding their time too. Tech darlings in the West have all been points of conversation in recent years when it comes to tech's next big IPO, but few have signaled direct intent to go public as markets go through their rough and tumble moment.
A Klarna IPO had been talked up right until it was forced to take a significant down round that slashed its valuation from $46 billion to $6.7 billion. Meanwhile, Stripe, which filed plans with the SEC to go public in 2021, has been hesitant to make another move, having laid off 14% of its staff towards the end of last year.
SpaceX is another big company around which IPO talks have been swirling, the rocket company led by Elon Musk. Given the challenges he's enduring with Twitter and Tesla, adding to his headaches with a public listing for SpaceX seems unlikely (though anything is possible with Musk).
Plans to publicly list Arm have already been pushed back from early 2023 over concerns surrounding a market gripped by fear But the company is still on course for an IPO this year, Ian Thorton, Arm's head of investor relations, wrote in a letter in November.
""Clearly, we want to IPO as soon as is possible. But given the current global economic uncertainty, given the state of financial markets, that's probably now unlikely to happen before the end of March 2023,"" the letter reportedly said.
Chip sector in turmoil
Arm's other challenge with going public in 2023 lies in the state of the chip sector: it's down.
Chip stocks, in particular, took a bruising in 2022 as supply-chain crunches and shortages triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic continued through the year, with only some sign of let-up for the sector's biggest players this year.
Still, many are continuing to suffer. Last week, South Korean giant Samsung announced that its operating profits fell by almost 70% in its fourth quarter amid lower demand for chips, spurred by reduced consumer spending on electronics and a chip oversupply.
Former Arm pursuer Nvidia, meanwhile, has seen its shares take a hit following new license requirements implemented by the US government. In an SEC filing, the company warned that the licenses would impact $400 million worth of sales to China in its third quarter last year.
Such export controls have already hit Arm, as it emerged last month that Alibaba was unable to buy chip designs from the British firm over fears that a license to sell high-performance designs to the Chinese tech giant wouldn't be approved. Such events are likely to spook would-be public investors in Arm at a time when they are belt-tightening.
There are some signs that Arm would be insulated from some of the market tumult: its growing focus on the car industry, for instance, has seen revenue for its automotive unit more than double since 2020 – a rare spot of subsisting demand, according to the Financial Times.
But with chip revenue set to fall by almost 4% in 2023 to $596 billion, per projections by Gartner, it is hard not to think that any IPO of Arm may just be throwing it into treacherous waters.",This year's blockbuster IPO is between a rock and a hard place: listing in New York or London won't change Arm's fortunes in brutal downturn,156.28,159.09,160.00999,1,2023,10

US Inflation Cools Again, Putting Fed on Track to Downshift
Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are among the biggest contributors to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s nearly 4% gain this week. Amazon, which tumbled 50% last year amid soaring interest rates and slowing revenue growth, is up 14% for its best week since April 2020, while graphics chipmaker Nvidia is up 13% over the last five sessions.
Investors are becoming more optimistic that inflation will continue to cool, which would allow the Federal Reserve to soon pause interest rate hikes that triggered a valuation reckoning last year for growth stocks. The December consumer price index released Thursday was the lowest in a year, adding to growing evidence that the Fed is starting to tame inflation even as central bankers insist there’s more work to be done.
“This is the market saying that it is more optimistic that things are better off than periods of last year, when recession narratives were dominating,” said Nick Getaz, portfolio manager for the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund. “We’re not out of the woods, but maybe we can see the clearing of the trees.”
Evidence of rising optimism wasn’t limited to the biggest US tech companies. A basket of unprofitable technology stocks tracked by Goldman Sachs is on pace for a 14% gain this week. Software maker Atlassian Corp. surged more than 20%, electric vehicle maker Lucid Group jumped 28% and Carvana Co., the beaten-down auto retailer, soared 68%.
Of course, not all tech stocks have outperformed this week. Zoom Video Communications Inc., Adobe Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. have all lagged behind the S&P 500 Index.
Franklin’s Getaz is skeptical that the rally can be sustained considering threats to economic growth and the likelihood that interest rates remain elevated. He’s looking forward to the fourth quarter earnings season that commenced this week to see if corporate profit estimates can hold up.
“It’s fair to say it is too early for the level of uplift we’ve seen,” he said. “There’s more evidence for why you should be optimistic, but I’m not sure there’s enough evidence to warrant this level of strength.”

The shares climbed as much as 8.7% to $225.55 after the report was released. They had earlier closed at $207.54 in New York.
The forecast signals that Nvidia’s push into AI computing chips continues to pay off. Under Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jensen Huang, the company has parlayed its dominance of graphics processors into a strong position in the growing market for AI hardware. Its chips excel at the kind of parallel processing that allows computers to make sense of large amounts of data and train software to make decisions.
But Nvidia’s reliance on the PC market for a large chunk of sales dragged on its results. Demand has dropped rapidly, and computer makers are slashing chip orders in an attempt to work through stockpiles of unused inventory.
The shares have already been the best performer in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index this year, gaining 42%. Investors have piled into Nvidia — making it the world’s most valuable chipmaker again — as they bet that demand for AI systems such as ChatGPT will boost orders for the Santa Clara, California-based company’s products.
The company’s gaming business — heavily reliant on the PC industry — had revenue of $1.83 billion last quarter, a decline of 46%. Still, it topped the average estimate of $1.6 billion.
Data-center sales grew 11% to $3.62 billion, coming in short of an average prediction of $3.86 billion.
Overall revenue fell 21% to $6.05 billion, marking Nvidia’s second decline in 13 quarters. Profit was 88 cents a share, minus certain items. On that basis, analysts had predicted a profit of 81 cents on sales of about $6 billion.

NVDA,2023-02-23 19:54:55,"Shares of the graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 14% Thursday, despite the fact that the company reported a 21% year-over-year revenue decline for its fourth quarter on Wednesday. The reason? A.I.","Shares of the graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 14% Thursday, despite the fact that the company reported a 21% year-over-year revenue decline for its fourth quarter on Wednesday. The reason? A.I.
Specifically, the hype surrounding A.I. applications like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing, and Google’s Bard, all of which require heavy-duty processing power that Nvidia’s chips are more than well suited for.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the company’s earnings call that the graphics giant is at an “inflection point,” and said that A.I. technologies and its ilk, are akin to the iPhone in technological importance.
“ChatGPT reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing,” Huang said. “And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging.”
It’s not just Nvidia’s hardware capabilities, either, though its high-powered H100 platform is already shipping to cloud-service providers. The company also announced it will begin offering a cloud-based A.I. as-a-service option that will let smaller companies take advantage of Nvidia’s processing power for training A.I. models including the kind that underpin ChatGPT.
But it’s about more than just the likes of ChatGPT, Arete Research Co-founder Brett Simpson told Yahoo Finance Live.
“Ultimately, the [computing] intensity of A.I. is far greater than conventional computing. So I think the revenue that’s associated with A.I. will be directly proportional to the computing opportunity here we see long term,” Simpson said. “The promise of this technology goes way beyond a chatbot so to speak.”
And Nvidia isn’t new to the A.I. market. The company has been investing in its data center business for years, and it’s clearly paying off, with revenue exploding over the past few years.
Data center business revenue jumped from $968 million in Q4 2019 to $3.62 billion in the latest quarter. And despite a broader slowdown in chip and cloud computing sales in the industry, Nvidia’s data center revenue jumped 11% year-over-year.
And as interest in more advanced A.I. systems become mainstream, Nvidia stands to benefit handsomely.
Of course, it’s difficult to discount Nvidia’s gaming business as well. While the company reported a 46% year-over-year decline in the segment, it reported a 16% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue. The gaming business is working its way through difficult comparisons to the pandemic era when consumers were spending their cash on new high-end graphics cards and gaming PCs. As we begin to lap those dates, however, the gaming picture will likely improve for the company.
For now though, Nvidia’s future is tied directly to A.I.

NVDA,2023-02-24 11:19:13,Catching you up with some calls you probably overlooked in another busy week for investing.,"The bond king roared. The stock market wobbled. Mortgage rates crept toward an eye-popping 7%.
Here are several calls in the market you probably missed during this busy week.
The Bond King Rings the Alarm
DoubleLine Capital founder and CEO Jeffrey Gundlach was in good spirits and top investing form when Yahoo Finance (video above) met him at his snazzy new industrial-themed office in Tampa, Florida, this week for am exclusive sit-down.
Gundlach struck a note of caution on the economic outlook (he sees a hard landing) but also rang the alarm bell to call attention to one market risk not many are thinking about yet.
""I don't know if it's a risk for this year ... but I think China taking over Taiwan is a very significant risk,"" he said. ""They [China] love the fact I'm sure that we are destroying a lot of our munitions in defense of Ukraine, which obviously depletes our ability to arm Taiwan. So they'd love us to blow up all our stuff in Ukraine. That balloon coming over, there's a lot of odd things going on that one should think that the risk of a greater escalation of hostilities is the odds on case.""
Here's what else Gundlach told us.
Nvidia Hype Forces the Hand of Goldman Sachs
A Yahoo Finance user favorite ticker — Nvidia (NVDA) — saw shares explode some 14% on Thursday. The move wasn't because the computing giant had an amazing fourth quarter — in fact, sales plunged 21% amid the broader tech demand pullback, as Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith broke down in a new ""After the Call"" segment.
But what the company did do is sell the sizzle on the buzzword of the moment in tech land: AI (a.k.a. artificial intelligence), as Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports.
An upbeat, AI-filled earnings call caused Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari to upgrade his rating on Nvidia's stock to buy from hold. Hari's new 12-month price target on Nvidia: $275, which assumes about 17% upside from current levels.
Said Hari in his upgrade note: ""In hindsight, we acknowledge that our decision to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of a pullback in the company’s fundamentals was wrong. Looking ahead, while we recognize that the stock has meaningfully outperformed the group year to date, we are upgrading the stock from neutral to buy with an updated 12-month price target of $275, as we believe the combination of positive estimate revisions and a potential expansion in the stock’s multiple — consistent with historical recovery phases — will drive continued outperformance in the stock.""

Here Comes a Big Day for Tesla ... and Maybe Deutsche Bank
Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian will be paying close attention to Tesla's investor day on March 1, where the Elon Musk-led EV maker is expected to release various software updates (among other new initiatives). Knowing the unpredictable Musk, he could very well provide an update on quarter-to-date demand.
One never knows with Elon.
But what Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner thinks he knows is a big move higher in Tesla's stock due to info stemming from the investor day.
""We believe [the investor day] has the potential to help the stock keep rerating higher,"" Rosner said in a client note.
He added: ""We expect the company to introduce Master Plan 3 and present the main drivers of its longer-term growth strategy, and in particular its 3rd generation vehicle platform which could support multiple future vehicles and segments at a lower price point. We also anticipate updates on its FSD [full self-driving] software V11, hardware HW4, Cybertruck/Semi production, project Highland refresh of Model 3, and ramp-up of the energy storage business. To support its volume and cost targets, we think Tesla will speak about the role of in-house battery manufacturing technology, capacity expansion, and actions to secure raw materials.""
Rosner lifted his price target on Tesla's stock to $250 from $220, which predicts roughly 24% upside from current levels. Of course, Rosner is all in with a buy rating on the stock.

At the chipmaker’s annual developer conference on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang positioned Nvidia as the engine behind “the iPhone moment of AI,” as he’s taken to calling this inflection point in computing. Spurred by a boom in consumer and enterprise applications, such as advanced chatbots and eye-popping graphics generators, “generative AI will reinvent nearly every industry,” Huang said.
The idea is to build infrastructure that can make AI apps faster and more accessible to customers. Nvidia’s graphics processing units have become the brains behind ChatGPT and its ilk, helping them digest and process ever-greater sums of training data. Microsoft Corp. revealed last week it had to string together tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 GPUs in data centers in order to handle the computational workload in the cloud for OpenAI, ChatGPT’s developer.
Other tech giants are following suit with similarly colossal cloud infrastructures geared for AI. Oracle Corp. announced that its platform will feature 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, the A100’s successor, for high-performance compute applications, and Nvidia said a forthcoming system from Amazon Web Services will be able to scale up to 20,000 interconnected H100s. Microsoft has likewise started adding the H100 to its server racks.
These kinds of chip superclusters are part of a push by Nvidia to rent out supercomputing services through a new program called DGX Cloud, hosted by Oracle and soon Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Nvidia said the goal is to make accessing an AI supercomputer as easy as opening a webpage, enabling companies to train their models without the need for on-premise infrastructure that’s costly to install and manage.
“Provide your job, point to your data set, and you hit go — and all of the orchestration and everything underneath is taken care of,” said Manuvir Das, Nvidia’s vice president of enterprise computing. The DGX Cloud service will start at $36,999 per instance per month, with each “instance”— essentially the amount of computing horsepower being rented — equating to eight H100 GPUs.
Nvidia also launched two new chips, one focused on enhancing AI video performance and the other an upgrade to the H100.
The latter GPU is designed specifically to improve the deployment of large language models like those used by ChatGPT. Called the H100 NVL, it can perform 12 times faster when handling inferences — that is, how AI responds to real-life queries — compared with the prior generation of A100s at scale in data centers.
Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing at Nvidia, said it will help “democratize ChatGPT use cases and bring that capability to every server and every cloud.”

(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp, the world's leading designer of computer chips used in creating artificial intelligence, on Monday showed new research that explains how AI can be used to improve chip design.
The process of designing a chip involves deciding where to place tens of billions of tiny on-off switches called transistors on a piece of silicon to create working chips. The exact placement of those transistors has a big impact on the chip's cost, speed and power consumption.
Chip design engineers use complex design software from firms like Synopsys Inc and Cadence Design Systems Inc to help them optimize the placement of those transistors.
On Monday, Nvidia released a paper showing that it could use a combination of artificial intelligence techniques to find better ways to place big groups of transistors. The paper aimed to improve on a 2021 paper by Alphabet Inc's Google, whose findings later became the subject of controversy.
The Nvidia research took an existing effort developed by University of Texas researchers using what is called reinforcement learning and added a second layer of artificial intelligence on top of it to get even better results.
Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally said the work is important because chip manufacturing improvements are slowing with per-transistor costs in new generations of chip manufacturing technology now higher than previous generations.
That goes against the famous prediction by Intel Corp co-founder Gordon Moore that chips would always get cheaper and faster.
""You're no longer actually getting an economy from that scaling,"" Dally said. ""To continue to move forward and to deliver more value to customers, we can't get it from cheaper transistors. We have to get it by being more clever on the design.""

The key supplier of chips required to power chatbots has more than doubled since hitting a two-year low in October, adding about $372 billion in market value. Now cracks may be starting to appear.
After nine straight sessions of gains through Thursday, the stock has slipped back the last three, after its relative strength index briefly strayed into overbought territory.
“Nvidia certainly looks frothy,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, adding that the stock’s multiples are “a bit too rich.”
Nvidia trades at an eye-watering 56 times projected earnings, nearly three times more expensive than the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index’s 21 times and a near 150% premium to the Nasdaq 100, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia’s average multiple over the past decade is 30 times.
The valuation is “bordering on a little breathless,” said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer of Adams Funds.
Nvidia is set to resume its upward momentum on Wednesday, rising 1.5% in premarket trading as chipmakers more broadly extend a year-to-date rally after upbeat forecasts from Micron Technology Inc. and Infineon Technologies AG.
The stock’s rapid ascent isn’t deterring Wall Street analysts. With 42 buy-equivalent ratings, Nvidia has by far the most bullish recommendations of any chipmaker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley upgraded to overweight this month, citing the boost the company is getting from the generational AI “megatrend.”
“When the case is just so compelling, you’ve got to own this,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, which owns Nvidia shares. “That’s how you get an overbought situation. Are we going to get another 80% from here in Nvidia in three months? No.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Nasdaq 100 futures rose on Wednesday, putting the tech-heavy gauge on course to snap two days of declines and extend its quarter-to-date gains. The benchmark is up 15% since year-end, setting it up for its best quarter since June 2020 after four straight declines.

The event came hot on the heels of the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4, the improved AI bot trained on both images and text. And fittingly, at the event, NVDA’s CEO Jensen Huang sat down with OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever to talk about all things AI. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill logged in to get the lowdown and came away with a “clearer understanding of why larger models are needed for accurate prediction.”
Sutskever touched on the history of neural networks and the progress made to get to where AI is at right now. One of the criticisms of current models is a lack of accuracy, and the next step will be centered around reliability with the need for users to trust the AI’s responses are accurate.
The response might be as straightforward as the AI “supporting retrieval” (providing source links), asking for clarification, or stating that it cannot answer without more information. Sutskever said these advances will occur within the next two years.
Having gained 83% year-to-date, NVDA stock has been a beneficiary of all this year’s AI talk, but Gill feels the “magnitude of what both Jensen and Ilya discussed, specifically adding video and audio to multi-model systems, has a much broader reach.” And based on “near-term data center strength, receding gaming headwinds, and greater traction in inference and software markets,” Gill anticipates NVDA’s valuation to increase.
In fact, based on “multiples towards the higher end of historical ranges,” the 5-star analyst raised the price target from $270 to $300, suggesting the shares have room for 12% growth in the year ahead. Unsurprisingly, Gill’s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)
Elsewhere on Wall Street, with the addition of 24 Buys, 7 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Most appear to think the shares have soared enough for now; the average price target currently stands at $274.81, suggesting modest gains of ~2%. (See Nvidia stock forecast)

NVDA,2023-03-29 20:48:39,The AI explosion could provide a salve for the chip industry's woes.,"The beaten down chip industry may be on the verge of a turnaround, and the AI explosion is at least partly to thank. That’s according to remarks by Micron (MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who says that the memory chip maker is finally returning to growth after three consecutive quarters of declines.
“We continue to see AI as a secular driver of demand growth in the data center,” Mehrotra said in prepared remarks following the company’s Q2 earnings announcement on Tuesday.
“We are well positioned to capture the memory and storage opportunities that AI and data-centric computing architectures will provide,” he added.
The semiconductor industry is coming off of some of its worst days in more than a decade thanks to the extreme highs and subsequent lows of the pandemic and post-pandemic economic environment.
“The semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last 13 years, with an exceptionally weak pricing environment that is significantly impacting our financial performance,” Mehrotra said.
The jump in interest around AI, however, could help turn that around as businesses across sectors look to take advantage of the trend.
Micron isn’t the only company that stands to benefit from the wild growth in AI. Nvidia (NVDA), which hosted its GTC developers conference last week, is also set to capitalize on the need for high-powered GPUs to power AI systems.
“We are seeing an acceleration in demand,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live during an interview following his keynote at the conference.
“We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We’re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI,” Huang added
Rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) could also stand to pick up some sales thanks to the hype around generative AI. And they could certainly use it.
Over the last 12 months, shares of Intel are off 35%, shares of Micron are down 19%, and shares of AMD have dropped 19%. Nvidia is the only one without a double-digit drop in share price, falling just 4%.
Micron isn’t just banking on the AI boom, though. The company is also working to bring down inventory levels to return to growth.
“Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we believe our balance sheet days of inventory outstanding (DIO) has peaked in fiscal Q2, and we are close to a transition to sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results,” he added.
The chip industry took a massive hit as consumers cut back on purchasing high-tech items during the tail end of the pandemic. It hasn’t helped that some businesses are also pulling back on purchases amid rising interest rates.
And as consumers and businesses stopped buying, chipmakers like Micron were left holding more inventory than necessary. But Micron says it’s managed to pare back its inventory levels enough to meet the current level of demand.
“We have taken substantial supply reduction and austerity measures, including executing a companywide reduction in force,” Mehrotra said. “We now believe that customer inventories have reduced in several end markets, and we see gradually improving supply-demand balance in the months ahead.”

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Intel Corp's former chief architect Raja Koduri is in talks with Hiranandani-backed data center operator Yotta for a deal for his generative artificial intelligence startup, which he said will have a big presence in India.
His yet-to-be-named firm would either partner or acquire Yotta, which has data centers in the cities of Mumbai and Noida, said Koduri, whose aim is to challenge Nvidia Corp's grip on the digital movie and video game markets.
The company is likely to be launched by the end of the year and will provide AI tools to creators including game designers and film industry workers, the Indian-American executive said in an interview to Reuters.
""These days if you breath you're competing with Nvidia because they have entered every space, everything, so you have no option but to compete against,"" he said on the sidelines of a conference in Bengaluru, dubbed India's Silicon Valley for its tech firms and startups, on Wednesday.
Koduri, who has worked on nearly two dozen generations of computer graphics chip, plans to build local data centers to ease the access to massive computing power needed for generative AI tools.
Generative AI refers to technology such as ChatGPT that can use prompts to whip up haikus, essays and images.
The data center plan, however, will face challenges from unstable power, shortage of skilled labor and the lack of clear policy from state and central governments.
The southern state of Karnataka and Telangana have been ""very supportive"", he said, adding that subsidies on electricity will be crucial as data centers are power guzzlers.
Koduri did not disclose how many people his firm would employ, but said ""a ton"" would be hired from the southern cities of Bengaluru and Hyderabad.
He is also joining the board of AI chip startup Tenstorrent, led by veteran chip architect Jim Keller, who led the design of Tesla's self-driving chip in 2016.

(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chips from Qualcomm Inc beat Nvidia Corp in two out of three measures of power efficiency in a new set of test data published on Wednesday, while a Taiwanese startup bested both in one category.
Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models with huge amounts of data. But after those AI models are trained, they are put to wider use in what is called ""inference"" by doing tasks like generating text responses to prompts and deciding whether an image contains a cat.
Analysts believe that the market for data center inference chips will grow quickly as businesses put AI technologies into their products, but companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google are already exploring how to keep the lid on the extra costs that doing so will add.
One of those major costs is electricity, and Qualcomm has used its history designing chips for battery-powered devices such as smartphones to create a chip called the Cloud AI 100 that aims for parsimonious power consumption.
In testing data published on Wednesday by MLCommons, an engineering consortium that maintains testing benchmarks widely used in the AI chip industry, Qualcomm's AI 100 beat Nvidia's flagship H100 chip at classifying images, based on how many data center server queries each chip can carry out per watt.
Qualcomm's chips hit 197.6 server queries per watt versus 108.4 queries per watt for Nvidia. Neuchips, a startup founded by veteran Taiwanese chip academic Youn-Long Lin, took the top spot with 227 queries per watt.
Qualcomm also beat Nvidia at object detection with a score of 3.2 queries per watt versus Nvidia's 2.4 queries per watt. Object detection can be used in applications like analyzing footage from retail stores to see where shoppers go most often.
Nvidia, however, took the top spot in both absolute performance terms and power efficiency terms in a test of natural language processing, which is the AI technology most widely used in systems like chatbots. Nvidia hit 10.8 samples per watt, while Neuchips ranked second at 8.9 samples per watt and Qualcomm was in third place at 7.5 samples per watt.

NVDA,2023-04-10 23:37:23,Gains in mega-cap tech stocks like Nvidia and Meta have helped generate $2.05 trillion of market value since the start of 2023.,"Twenty stocks concentrated in tech have driven 90% of gains in the S&P 500 this year.
The surge is due to easing concerns around interest rates amid uncertainty in financial stocks.
Still, the tech rally may fade, as a strong job market data may force further interest hikes.
Twenty stocks are almost entirely responsible for the $2.36 trillion in maket value added to the S&P 500 so far this year, according to the Financial Times.
The surge in value — accounting for 90% of the index's gains — demonstrates how recent banking turmoil eased shareholder fears of aggressive interest rate hikes and allowed for a Big Tech rally.
""People are looking for safety and comfort given the cross-currents in the market, and tech gives them plenty of ease,"" JPMorgan's Jack Atherton told FT.
Out of the 20 stocks, some of the biggest market cap expansions included the chipmaker Nvidia, which has gained 83% so far this year, and Meta, jumping by 75%. Apple, topping the S&P by index weight, surged by 28%.
Together, these megacap stocks are responsible for the $2.05 trillion of market value added to S&P 500 year-to-date, compared to $320 billion of value created by the index's other stocks.
It marks a sharp turnaround from 2022, when the tech sector was especially battered as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in order to combat high inflation.
But as bank runs dominated headlines in March, investors flocked to tech, which had limited exposure to the financial sector and was already gaining momentum from new trends, such as artificial intelligence.
At the same time — with banks tightening their lending standards to avoid a further contagion — the Fed moderated its aggressive tightening policy. Despite expectations for a larger hike, the central bank lifted interest by only a quarter of a percentage point in March.
However, it remains to be seen for how long these gains may last, as last month's strong labor market indicates that the Fed may not be completely done lifting interest rates, Economist Mohamed El-Erian said.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson has previously warned against putting too much faith in the tech rally, as markets have not priced in earnings pressures.",Just 20 stocks on the S&P 500 are responsible for nearly all its gains this year as Big Tech leads rally,270.37,275.79001,271.69,4,2023,10

NVDA,2023-04-20 12:00:20,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility...","Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?
When Is Debt A Problem?
Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.
See our latest analysis for NVIDIA
What Is NVIDIA's Debt?
As you can see below, NVIDIA had US$11.0b of debt, at January 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$13.3b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$2.34b.
How Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?
The latest balance sheet data shows that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$6.56b due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.5b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$13.3b in cash and US$3.83b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.96b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.
This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$688.8b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!
In fact NVIDIA's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 44% in the last twelve months. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 82% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.
Summing Up
We could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$2.34b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$3.8b, being 82% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with NVIDIA's use of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the 3 warning signs we've spotted with NVIDIA .
At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.

NVDA,2023-04-20 12:30:23,"CoreWeave, an NYC-based startup that began as an Ethereum mining venture, has secured a large tranche of funding as it continues to transition to a general-purpose cloud computing platform. CoreWeave today announced that it raised $221 million in a Series B funding round led by Magnetar Capital with participation from Nvidia, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and ex-Apple exec Daniel Gross. Magnetar contributed $111 million, with the remainder of the investment being split between Nvidia, Friedman and Gross.","CoreWeave, an NYC-based startup that began as an Ethereum mining venture, has secured a large tranche of funding as it continues to transition to a general-purpose cloud computing platform.
CoreWeave today announced that it raised $221 million in a Series B funding round led by Magnetar Capital with participation from Nvidia, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and ex-Apple exec Daniel Gross. Magnetar contributed $111 million, with the remainder of the investment being split between Nvidia, Friedman and Gross. An Nvidia spokesperson said that the investment represents a ""deepening"" of its partnership with CoreWeave.
The tranche, which values CoreWeave at $2 billion pre-money and brings the company's total raised to $371 million, will be used to support CoreWeave's U.S.-based data center expansion with the opening of two new centers this year, CEO Mike Intrator said. CoreWeave currently operates five in North America.
CoreWeave was founded in 2017 by Intrator, Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee to address what they saw as ""a void"" in the cloud market. Venturo, a hobbyist Ethereum miner, cheaply acquired GPUs from insolvent cryptocurrency mining farms, choosing Nvidia hardware for the increased memory (hence Nvidia's investment in CoreWeave, presumably).
Initially, CoreWeave was focused exclusively on cryptocurrency applications. But it pivoted within the last several years to general-purpose computing as well as generative AI technologies, like text-generating AI models.
Fast-forward to today and CoreWeave provides access to over a dozen SKUs of Nvidia GPUs in the cloud, including H100s, A100s, A40s and RTX A6000s, for use cases like AI and machine learning, visual effects and rendering, batch processing and pixel streaming.
""Our clients include generative AI companies, like Tarteel AI and Anlatan, the creators of NovelAI, and we’ve supported a range of open source AI and machine learning projects like EleutherAI and Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion,"" Intrator told TechCrunch in an email interview. ""We also work with a number of notable VFX and animation studios such as Spire Animation, and partner closely with 3D streaming and 'metaverse' companies such as PureWeb.""
It's tough for any cloud provider to compete with the incumbents in the space -- i.e., Google, Amazon and Microsoft. For perspective, AWS made $80.1 billion in revenue last year, while Google Cloud and Azure made $75.3 billion and $26.28 billion, respectively.
Those figures are multiples above CoreWeave's valuation, obviously, let alone its war chest.
To drive the point home, according to a Statista report from the fourth quarter of 2022, AWS had a 32% market share, Azure had a 23% share and Google Cloud had a 10% share.
That's not to say it's impossible for a smaller player to succeed. There's success stories like Paperspace, Scaleway and DigitalOcean (despite its ups and downs), as well as newer entrants like Clever Cloud and Vultr.
CoreWeave is evidence of this also, it'd seem. The startup managed to secure funding even coming off of a rough quarter for the cloud infrastructure market. As my colleague Ron Miller wrote, companies looked for ways to cut back on spending in an uncertain economy, slowing the market to 21% growth -- a precipitous drop from the 36% growth in the year prior.
""We have over 1,000 customers across our four key verticals -- machine learning and AI, batch processing, pixel streaming and visual effects and rendering,"" Intrator said.
CoreWeave makes the case that the dominant cloud providers -- Google Cloud, Azure and AWS -- have failed to meet the demand for generative AI in particular with their ""legacy cloud infrastructure."" Them's fighting words, to be sure, especially as AWS launches a dedicated service for serving text-generating models. But in Intrator's eyes, the incumbents aren't set up to meet the demand of thousands of new AI companies clamoring for GPUs -- at least not at CoreWeave's (ostensibly lower) prices.
CoreWeave claims its hardware for inference -- i.e., serving AI models -- is industry leading, able to ""autoscale"" within three seconds. It also touts its newer instance products, which include Nvidia's HGX H100 server platform.
""For a while now, technology decision-makers have faced the increasingly complex -- and costly -- task of deploying their highly specialized compute tasks supporting modern AI and machine learning applications to more generalized cloud computer providers,"" Intrator said. ""CoreWeave recognizes this demand will require deep investment in scalable and attainable capacity for the next generation of innovative AI firms.""
Beyond infrastructure, CoreWeave attempts to differentiate itself with offerings like its accelerator program, which launched in late October. (Intrator says it has over 30 members.) The accelerator -- which operates on an open-ended basis, with no deadlines -- provides companies compute credits in addition to discounts and other hardware resources on the CoreWeave cloud.
Intrator says that the new tranche will lead to more efforts like this.
""With the emergence of CoreWeave and this new investment, it can service more companies with even more customized solutions that can outperform legacy cloud providers,"" he added. ""While large language models and deep learning image generation technologies have been around for a while, their prominent place in the public eye is driving an intense scramble to secure processing power for ever more powerful applications. CoreWeave recognizes this demand will require deep investment in scalable and attainable capacity for the next generation of innovative AI firms.""
It'll also be put toward expanding CoreWeave's team. The company employs ""just over"" 115 people now -- up 150% in the last 12 months -- thanks in part to its acquisition of the cloud rendering platform Conductor Technologies in January, and Intrator says that the plan is to keep hiring ""throughout the year.""
The question is, of course, whether CoreWeave can maintain its impressive momentum -- particularly if the generative AI bubble bursts anytime soon. For what it's worth, Friedman and Gross seem convinced by the strategy. They sent this statement via email:","CoreWeave, a GPU-focused cloud compute provider, lands $221M investment",279.31,271.04001,271.19,4,2023,20

NVDA,2023-04-27 18:11:23,"The core business for Meta since the early days of Facebook has been advertising sales, which still account for 98% of the company’s quarterly revenue. So naturally, enhancing advertisements with A.I. is where Meta believes the new technology can be most impactful.","Meta (META) stock hit a new 52-week high on Thursday as investors celebrated the company’s return to revenue growth. One of the key drivers: artificial intelligence.
Further integration of A.I. helped drive Meta’s first revenue increase in three quarters, the company said on Wednesday. Reels monetization is up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook on a quarterly basis as A.I. plays a larger role in the platforms.
Time spent on Instagram went up by 24% since Meta launched A.I.-powered Instagram reels.
“(Generative A.I.) is going to also help create more engaging experiences, which should create more engagement,” Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday evening. “And that by itself creates more opportunities for advertisers.”
In the first quarter, Meta delivered advertising revenue of $28.1 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $26.76. The company’s $2.20 earnings per share also topped analyst expectations of $2.01. Meta projects second quarter revenue in a range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion, above estimates of $29.48 billion.
The stock of the company, formerly known as Facebook, rose as much as 14% in intraday trading on Thursday.
A.I. is having its moment on tech earnings calls for the second consecutive quarter, following the widely popular launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late November. But not every company has the same plans for the new technology.
Nvidia (NVDA) is selling A.I. powered supercomputers. Microsoft (MSFT) is integrating ChatGPT into its search engine to compete with Google (GOOGL), which has its own A.I. searchbot.
Meta’s approach is slightly different. The core business for Meta since the early days of Facebook has been advertising sales, which still account for 98% of the company’s quarterly revenue. So naturally, enhancing advertisements with A.I. is where Meta believes the new technology can be most impactful.
“We're just playing a different game on the infrastructure than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us,” Zuckerberg said when explaining why Meta is open-sourcing its A.I.
Meta’s push into A.I. comes as the company is still bleeding from its steep Metaverse investments. Meta’s Reality Labs reported an operating loss of $4 billion in the first quarter, compared to an operating loss of $3 billion in the same period last year.
Those losses had weighed heavily on Meta’s stock in the past, but amid Meta’s “year of efficiency,” cost-cutting efforts and A.I. benefits have Wall Street turning more bullish. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank research analyst Benjamin Black highlighted AI-driven ad performance as a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth through the rest of 2023.
“The improvement in Meta's (A.I. and machine learning) capabilities are not only improving Reels' content ranking and recommendation algorithm, which in turn drives user engagement, but [it] also increases the efficiency of ad delivery, which increases monetization of the service,” Black wrote.
Zuckerberg noted on the earnings call he feels Meta is “no longer behind"" in building out an A.I. infrastructure. Now, the focus shifts to finding new ways to integrate and optimize the technology.
“This is literally going to touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways,” Zuckerbeg said. “This is just a very big wave and new set of technologies that's available, and we're working on it across the whole company.

Japan, S.Korea revive stalled economic talks as global risks rise
INCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) -Japan and South Korea held their first finance leaders' meeting in seven years on Tuesday and agreed to resume regular dialogue as tensions in the wider region and slowing growth prod them to increase co-operation and mend strained relations. The resumption of bilateral financial discussions comes ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's planned visit to South Korea on Sunday and Monday for talks with President Yoon Suk Yeol. It also came as Asian policymakers, gathering for the annual Asian Development Bank (ADB) meeting this week in the South Korean city of Incheon, discussed regional economic challenges and ways to beef up buffers against various shocks.

Wells Fargo Says Buy These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks — Including One With 10% Yield
The latest economic data presents a mixed picture for the US economy. The growth data for the first quarter has been released, indicating that the GDP increased by only 1.1%, which is a sharp slowdown from 2H22, and feeding fears of a recession later this year. On the inflation front, the steady rise in prices has been easing back, and the March year-over-year number was just 5%, below the forecast and the lowest in nearly 2 years.

But Nvidia has created variants of its chips for the Chinese market that are slowed down to meet U.S. rules.,"By Stephen Nellis, Josh Ye and Jane Lanhee Lee
(Reuters) - U.S. microchip export controls imposed last year to freeze China's development of supercomputers used to develop nuclear weapons and artificial-intelligence systems like ChatGPT are having only minimal effects on China's tech sector.
The rules restricted shipments of Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc chips that have become the global technology industry's standard for developing chatbots and other AI systems.
But Nvidia has created variants of its chips for the Chinese market that are slowed down to meet U.S. rules. Industry experts told Reuters the newest one - the Nvidia H800, announced in March - will likely take 10% to 30% longer to carry out some AI tasks and could double some costs compared with Nvidia's fastest U.S. chips.
Even the slowed Nvidia chips represent an improvement for Chinese firms. Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, in April estimated that systems using Nvidia's H800 will cut the time it takes to train its largest AI system by more than half, from 11 days to four days.
""The AI companies that we talk to seem to see the handicap as relatively small and manageable,"" said Charlie Chai, a Shanghai-based analyst with 86Research.
The back-and-forth between government and industry exposes the U.S. challenge of slowing China's progress in high tech without hurting U.S. companies.
Part of the U.S. strategy in setting the rules was to avoid such a shock that the Chinese would ditch U.S. chips altogether and redouble their own chip-development efforts.
""They had to draw the line somewhere, and wherever they drew it, they were going to run into the challenge of how to not be immediately disruptive, but how to also over time degrade China's capability,"" said one chip industry executive who requested anonymity to talk about private discussions with regulators.
The export restrictions have two parts. The first puts a ceiling on a chip's ability to calculate extremely precise numbers, a measure designed to limit supercomputers that can be used in military research. Chip industry sources said that was an effective action.
But calculating extremely precise numbers is less relevant in AI work like large language models where the amount of data the chip can chew through is more important.
Nvidia is selling the H800 to China's largest technology firms, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc for use in such work, though it has not yet started shipping the chips in high volumes.
""The government isn’t seeking to harm competition or U.S. industry, and allows U.S. firms to supply products for commercial activities, such as providing cloud services for consumers,"" Nvidia said in a statement last week.
China is an important customer for U.S. technology, it added.
""The October export controls require that we create products with an expanding gap between the two markets,"" Nvidia said last week. We comply with the regulation while offering as-competitive-as-possible products in each market.""
Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, said in a separate statement this week that “this gap will grow quickly over time as training requirements continue to double every six to 12 months.""
A spokesperson for the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department that oversees the rules, did not return a request for comment.
SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPED
The second U.S. limit is on chip-to-chip transfer speeds, which does affect AI. The models behind technologies such as ChatGPT are too large to fit onto a single chip. Instead, they must be spread over many chips - often thousands at a time - which all need to communicate with one another.
Nvidia has not disclosed the China-only H800 chip's performance details, but a specification sheet seen by Reuters shows a chip-to-chip speed of 400 gigabytes per second, less than half the peak speed of 900 gigabytes per second for Nvidia's flagship H100 chip available outside China.
Some in the AI industry believe that is still plenty of speed. Naveen Rao, chief executive of a startup called MosaicML that specializes in helping AI models to run better on limited hardware, estimated a 10-30% system slowdown.
""There are ways to get around all this algorithmically,"" he said. ""I don't see this being a boundary for a very long time - like 10 years.""
Money helps. A chip in China that takes twice as long to finish an AI training task than a faster U.S. chip can still get the work done. ""At that point, you've got to spend $20 million instead of $10 million to train it,"" said one industry source who requested anonymity because of agreements with partners. ""Does that suck? Yes it does. But does that mean this is impossible for Alibaba or Baidu? No, that's not a problem.""
Moreover, AI researchers are trying to slim down the massive systems they have built to cut the cost of training products similar to ChatGPT and other processes. Those will require fewer chips, reducing chip-to-chip communications and lessening the impact of the U.S. speed limits.
Two years ago the industry was thinking AI models would get bigger and bigger, said Cade Daniel, a software engineer at Anyscale, a San Francisco startup that provides software to help companies perform AI work.
""If that were still true today, this export restriction would have a lot more impact,"" Daniel said. ""This export restriction is noticeable, but it's not quite as devastating as it could have been.""

Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office increased its stake in Nvidia Corp., a chipmaker that’s been a key beneficiary of the increased interest in AI, according to the firm’s quarterly 13F filing. Nvidia’s stock is up 98% so far this year, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 Index.
“AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet,” Druckenmiller said at the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference last week.
Duquesne Family Office added more than 208,000 shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, increasing the market value of the firm’s holding in the chipmaker to about $220 million.
Tepper’s Appaloosa Management added a new position in Nvidia, buying 150,000 shares with a market value of about $41.7 million. The firm also bought 500,000 new shares of Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, which invests in companies that create disruptive technologies. While the fund has lost three-quarters of its value since its high in early 2021, it has gained 23% this year.
Duquesne Family Office added a large new position in Microsoft Corp., which now makes up 9% of the firm’s roughly $2.3 billion US equities portfolio. Microsoft has a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT tool has lit up the internet.
Druckenmiller’s firm also added a new position in Iqvia Holdings Inc., a health-care technology company that says on its website it has “transformative AI capabilities” to help with its research and commercial efforts. Duquesne bought about 474,500 shares of the company during the first quarter with a market value of $94 million.
The two investing legends built their fortunes as hedge fund managers. Druckenmiller has a net worth of $9.9 billion and Tepper has a net worth of $16.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Money managers overseeing more than $100 million in US equities have to file a 13F form within 45 days of the end of each quarter to list their holdings in stocks that trade on US exchanges. It’s one of the few places to gain insight into how hedge funds and some large family offices invest.
Here are other highlights from 13F filings:
Iconiq Capital continued to slash its stake in cloud-computing company Snowflake Inc. in the first quarter, selling 4.85 million shares. The market value of its holding totaled about $1 billion, down $625 million from the prior quarter. The San Francisco-based firm only made two new buys in the first quarter, adding small positions in game companies Roblox Corp. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. worth less than $1 million.
The Saudi sovereign wealth fund bought almost 8.8 million shares of Electronic Arts Inc. during the first quarter, when the stock slumped following a disappointing earnings outlook. The Saudis held about 16 million shares prior to the first quarter, and held 24.8 million, with a market value of $2.99 billion, as of March 31. That makes them the largest outside stockholder in EA.
George Soros’s investment firm cut holdings in electric-vehicle makers, slashing a stake in Rivian Automotive Inc. after a 90% share decline. Soros Fund Management also sold off its entire $16 million position in Tesla Inc., which it acquired during a big tech push in the second quarter of 2022. It trimmed other tech-related bets, including stakes in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Salesforce Inc. and Intuit Inc.
The investment firm that manages the Walton family’s fortune bought more shares of the nearly $38 billion Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF. WIT LLC also added a new position in the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF with a market value of roughly $10 million.

Analysts at top banks including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and BofA warn the sector faces a selloff as a recession looms.
Here is a selection of the most recent Wall Street commentary on tech stocks.
Mega-cap tech stocks powered the US equity market's impressive gains so far in 2023, but a growing chorus of analysts now warn of a selloff in the sector as an economic downturn looms.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is up 18% year-to-date, propelled by stellar gains in the likes of Meta Platforms and Nvidia, each of which has jumped around 98%. Chipmaker AMD rallied 50%, while electric-vehicle maker Tesla rose 35%. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet advanced around 32% each.
Investors have been drawn to tech stocks by their strong run, the buzz over artificial-intelligence since the release of ChatGPT, as well as expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon end its interest-rate increases as inflation cools.
But with the economic outlook turning gloomy and the banking turmoil fueling fears of a credit crunch, analysts including those from big Wall Street banks such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America warn that tech stocks are in for a setback.
However, not everyone agrees. There are some, like Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who think the sector's rally still has room to extend. Below is a selection of the latest tech-stock outlooks from Wall Street analysts.
Chris Toomey, Morgan Stanley
The technology sector isn't immune to economic risks - and could be the ""next domino"" to fall as part of an overall stock-market decline, Toomey, a managing director at the Wall Street bank's wealth management division, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday.
""I don't think the technology industry is immune from the overall economy,"" he said, adding that the US is heading into a earnings downturn and is vulnerable to an economic slump.
""We now are officially going into an earnings recession. There's is a 50-50 chance, depending on which way you look, as to whether we're going into an actual economic recession,"" he said.
Jason Hunter, JPMorgan
Mega-cap stocks have powered the equity rally of 2023, but these market leaders now face a bigger selloff risk than other names as a recession looms, according to JPMorgan strategist Jason Hunter.
""At some point, and as the growth data starts to decelerate more toward negative growth territory, that's when you tend to see flight to quality turn into flight to cash,"" Hunter told CNBC Thursday.
""And you see that rotation where we actually think these mega-cap names may temporarily – they may be more at risk than the cyclical companies because of the crowding that's developed here.""
Michael Hartnett, Bank of America
This year's sizzling rally in tech stocks could be stopped in its tracks by a recession, according to the Bank of America strategist.
Michael Hartnett - who correctly called last year's selloff - said in a research note Friday that he expects a ""recession to crack credit and tech as in '08,"" referring to the economic slump that dragged down stocks after the global financial crisis.
Tom Lee, Fundstrat
However, Fundstrat's managing partner and head of research Tom Lee thinks some of the big tech stocks still have room to advance further.
""Our base case for FAANG this year was that it could rise as much as 50%,"" Lee told CNBC earlier this month, referring to the five largest US tech companies including Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.
""You can't really say that you're going to have diminished demand for these products. It's actually going to grow, and there's not new competition,"" Lee said. ""So actually that their ability to make future profits is higher, and that's why I think their PE could expand. And again, that really pulls up the whole market.""

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller's family office loaded up on Nvidia shares and made a new Microsoft investment last quarter, signaling a big push into artificial intelligence-related stocks.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The Alliance for Open Media (AOM), whose members include Alphabet unit Google, Amazon, Apple and Meta, on Tuesday dodged a possible fine after EU antitrust regulators closed an investigation into its video licensing policy.
The European Commission, which acts as the competition enforcer for the 27-country bloc, had been investigating alleged anti-competitive behaviour related to the licence terms of AOM's new standard software for streaming called AV1 since last year.
""The Commission decided to close the investigation for priority reasons. The closure is not a finding of compliance or non-compliance of the conduct in question with EU competition rules,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive said in an email.

What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
Apple (AAPL) is the largest company in the S&P 500.
It is also the largest large company the stock market has seen since at least 1980.
With a market cap north of $2.7 trillion, Apple currently comprises roughly 7.4% of the entire index's value, the highest share since 1980, according to data from Creative Planning's chief market strategist Charlie Bilello.
This is more than a full percentage point above the share of the index held by IBM (IBM) back in its ""Big Blue"" heyday in the mid-80s. A time when the company's dominance in the personal computer market was being challenged by a tiny upstart called Apple Computer.
Concentration among the leaders of the S&P 500 has been a feature of the stock market for years.
And 2023 is no different.
Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up more than 9% with just 7 tech stocks driving all of the gains for the index, according to strategists at Bank of America Global Research — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA).
Together, the S&P 500's five largest companies represent 22% of the index's value. And Apple alone is now worth more than the entire Russell 2000 (which has been hit hard by the crisis rocking regional banks).
For investors, Bank of America's takeaway is that buying the equal-weighted S&P 500 may be more attractive than the traditional market-cap weighted index.
Intuitively, a small handful of companies accounting for the bulk of the increase in what investors call the ""benchmark index"" sounds like the stock market itself is in a fragile state.
Go back a few years in this debate and we find strategists noting that the largest companies in the index also account for an outsized portion of profits earned by companies in the index. A trend which continues to hold up.
According to Bilello's data, Apple and Microsoft currently combine for just over 14% of the S&P 500's entire value.
And looking at data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, net income at Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft has totaled just over $222 billion over the last 12 months — or about 14% of aggregate profits earned by the entire S&P 500 over that period.

Nvidia Surpasses $1 Trillion Market Valuation in Massive AI Bet
The stock rose as much as 7.7% early in the session, putting Nvidia well into $1 trillion territory, before paring the gains. Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are the only other US businesses to have trillion-dollar valuations, and fewer than 10 companies globally have achieved the distinction.
As of 12:48 p.m. in New York, Nvidia’s market capitalization stood at $995.3 billion.
No other company embodies Wall Street’s current obsession with AI more than Nvidia. It has become the world’s biggest maker of the specialized chips needed to power a new generation of AI products, surpassing Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. in capability just as the viral success of ChatGPT has virtually every company around the world baking AI into its operations.
In a speech at the National Taiwan University over the weekend, Jensen Huang shared the philosophy that has brought his company to this moment: “Run, don’t walk,” he said. “Either you are running for food, or you are running from becoming food.”
Huang’s urgency — and his willingness to take risks that other rule-by-committee businesses dare not — is what compelled Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker he founded 30 years ago, to make big bets on artificial intelligence years before anyone else was taking it seriously. Today, it’s proving to be the company’s golden goose.
Nvidia’s shares have soared since last week when it gave an AI-fueled sales forecast that shattered Wall Street’s estimates. The stock continued to gain Tuesday after announcing several new artificial intelligence-related products over the weekend that touch on everything from robotics to gaming to advertising and networking. Huang also unveiled an AI supercomputer platform that will help tech companies create their own versions of ChatGPT.
“It’s too much,” Huang said during his presentation of the platform in Taiwan. “I know it’s too much.”

Not everyone is bullish. In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, Cathie Wood, whose flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund cut its holding in Nvidia in January, warned that the computer-chip industry’s boom-bust cycles pose risks. “There are a few reasons we take some pause,” she said, with competition growing among firms for a piece of the AI market. She called Nvidia a “a check-the-box stock.”

Huang has a knack for riding tech trends — selling graphics chips that powered everything from the video game boom to the rise of cryptocurrency and the industry’s big bet on the metaverse. But arguably no trend stands to benefit his company, today the world’s most valuable chip company, more than the rise of artificial intelligence.
Last week, the company issued an AI-fueled sales forecast of $11 billion in the fiscal second quarter, blowing Wall Street targets out of the water and growing its value by $184 billion in a single day.
“We have never seen a guide like the one Nvidia just put up,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said at the time.

Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Huang. It proved more successful than its peers at developing chips that turn computer code into the realistic images that computer gamers love, and rode out a wave of consolidation that saw its rivals acquired, bankrupted or merged into larger companies.
Under Huang, the company then pushed its technology into new markets, such as data center servers and artificial intelligence processing — a move that’s proving prescient today. In less than a decade, Nvidia’s data center business has grown from $300 million in annual revenue to $15 billion. The chipmaker has won orders to equip giant computing factories by successfully arguing that graphics chips can handle AI workloads better than more standard processors.

It’s become commonplace for tech companies to talk up their artificial intelligence prospects during earnings conference calls. References to AI soared after the launch of ChatGPT in November, and they don’t always spark a stock rally. But Nvidia has now become the model of a company that’s actually making money from AI. It’s the seller of picks and shovels in the gold-rush analogy.
Nvidia’s success has made investors even gloomier about Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer and the company most synonymous with computer chips. While many chipmakers saw their stocks gain in the wake of Nvidia’s blockbuster earnings last week, Intel actually fell. Nvidia’s valuation is now more than eight times that of Intel, despite the company having far less revenue.

NVDA,2023-05-30 17:07:10,"""ChatGPT will be the next leg of the growth stool"" for the tech giant, Dan Ives said in a research note.","Microsoft's market capitalization could jump $300 billion thanks to the rise of AI, according to Wedbush.
""ChatGPT will be the next leg of the growth stool"" for the tech giant, Dan Ives said in a research note.
Ives’ bullish outlook comes after chipmaker Nvidia posted stunning gains last week on the evidence that AI had boosted its sales.
Microsoft shares' 2023 rally will continue thanks to the Redmond-based tech giant's efforts to integrate ChatGPT and artificial intelligence into its business model, according to Wedbush.
""ChatGPT will be the next leg of the growth stool for Microsoft,"" Ives said Monday in a research note seen by Insider.
""Redmond is just starting to hit its next gear of growth with ChatGPT and AI also adding a new layer of growth to the Microsoft story over the coming years,"" he added.
Ives upped his price target for the tech stock from $340 to $375 a share – up 13% from its current $333 level, equivalent to adding $300 billion worth of market capitalization.
His bullish note comes the week after Nvidia saw its valuation surge by nearly $200 billion after it issued a second-quarter sales forecast that crushed Wall Street's expectations thanks to the rise of AI fueling demand for its chips.
Ives expects Microsoft to enjoy similar gains as it integrates the intelligent language tool into its Azure cloud business, Bing search engine, and Office 365 suite of products.
""We believe Nvidia's 'jaw-dropping guidance' heard around the world is a direct AI barometer for Redmond as our recent checks confirm the monetization opportunity for Microsoft is happening much sooner than the Street had anticipated in the field,"" he wrote.
""Over the last few weeks in our numerous conversations with Microsoft customers, partners, and field checks it has become clear to us that the monetization opportunities around deploying AI and ChatGPT in the cloud is a transformational opportunity across the industry, with Redmond in the driver's seat,"" Ives added.
Microsoft shares are already up 39% in 2023, benefiting from both the ChatGPT craze and traders' expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon pause its interest-rate hiking campaign.

NVDA,2023-06-01 00:13:48,The key to Nvidia's success is its full-stack platform that combines both the hardware and software necessary for generative artificial intelligence.,"Nvidia stock still has 26% upside after its eye-popping year-to-date rally of 170%, according to Bank of America.
The bank said Nvidia's recent launch of the DGX GH200 AI supercomputer solidifies its lead in the AI arms race.
""Nvidia [is] uniquely positioned with a full-stack of AI silicon, software, scale, supply and developer ecosystem,"" Bank of America said.
Even after Nvidia's dizzying year-to-date rally of 167%, the stock still has an additional 26% upside from current levels, according to a Tuesday note from Bank of America.
The bank reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on the stock and raised its price target to $500 from $450 after the company launched a slew of new products over the holiday weekend, including an AI supercomputer that solidifies its lead in the artificial intelligence arms race.
""Key product announcements at Computex only further bolster Nvidia's AI position, benefitting from early-mover advantage and strong execution,"" BofA said.
The bank highlighted that the company has entered full volume production of its H100 and HGX H100 servers, which currently sell on eBay for upwards of $45,000. The chips help enable generative large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.
Nvidia also unveiled the new DGX GH200 AI supercomputer, which combines up to 256 GH200 Superchips. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet will be the first mega-cap tech companies to gain access to the chips, according to the note.
The key to Nvidia's success is its full-stack platform that combines both the hardware and software necessary for generative artificial intelligence, according to the bank.
That full-stack approach has transformed Nvidia into a ""data center powerhouse"" as companies incorporate the company's GPU hyperscaler chips into their infrastructure, BofA said. The strength is evidenced by Nvidia's partnership with more than 1,600 generative AI startup companies, and that's just the beginning, according to the note.
""AI upside is driving strong performance year-to-date, but we believe we are only at the start of the story. Only ~15% of cloud servers are accelerated today, becoming more essential as GPUs are required for proper training of LLMs,"" BofA said.
Nvidia is also making inroads in the networking space thanks to its 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, and building out its network pipeline could ultimately help Nvidia better monetize the fast-growth opportunity in AI. Additionally, Nvidia's gaming business is set to see seasonal strength in the second half of the year.
""In-turn, we continue to see long-term EPS power of $20, which could be conservative with growing data center portfolio driving margin expansion,"" BofA said. Nvidia earned less than $2 per share over the past year, so a jump to $20 in annual earnings per share speaks to the real growth potential for Nvidia.
""Nvidia [is] uniquely positioned with a full-stack of AI silicon, software, scale, supply and developer ecosystem to transform the nearly $1 trillion traditional data centers market,"" BofA said.","Nvidia stock can still climb another 26% as supercomputer launch solidifies its lead in the AI arms race, Bank of America says",378.34,397.70001,393.26999,6,2023,1
NVDA,2023-06-01 02:38:44,The S&P 500 is up this year on a top-heavy rally in Nvidia and other tech stocks. BlackRock says an alternative look at the index reveals recession fears.,"The jump in S&P 500's big tech stocks is masking concerns among investors that the US is already in recession, BlackRock Investment Institute says.
The index on an equal-weighted basis is down so far in 2023.
The US has logged back-to-back quarters of contraction in gross domestic income.
Nvidia stock is crushing it this year along with other mega-cap tech shares in the S&P 500, but BlackRock says stripping out those big movers reveals that investors may believe that the US economy is already contracting.
Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are the S&P 500's five largest stocks by market capitalization, and they've largely held sway over its direction this year. Nvidia's stock has rocketed up 170% on the buzz about AI technology, and the chipmaker on Tuesday was briefly thrust beyond a $1 trillion valuation.
But for the S&P 500, a ""deeper look reveals stocks reflect worsening growth,"" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a note published this week.
The S&P 500 has tacked on about 9% this year. But the group said after applying equal weighting to all of the index's constituents regardless of size, it's down by more than 1%.
BlackRock's reference to growth stems from its view that the effect of rate hikes by global central banks to tame inflation is starting to kick in. Recent data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, indicates that the country has entered a recession despite experiencing an energy shock that was less severe than widely anticipated.
""In the U.S., GDP has held up but it has arguably entered recession based on gross domestic income, which assesses the economy's performance on an income rather than spending basis,"" said Boivin.
Last week, the government said gross domestic income declined 2.3% in the first quarter of 2023 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. That followed a 3.3% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2002, with the back-to-back quarterly shrinkage indicating a recession. Gross domestic income measures incomes earned and costs incurred in production.
And with inflation still running above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, policymakers may deliver another increase in interest rates.
""Markets are no longer pricing in repeated Fed rate cuts, a sign they're grasping inflation's persistence, in our view,"" said BlackRock.
The Fed in May issued its 10th consecutive rate hike. Its aggressive series of hikes last year contributed to driving the S&P 500 down more than 18% last year. The benchmark Fed funds rate stood at 5%-5.25%.",Mega-cap tech dominance in the S&P 500 is obscuring investor bets that the US may already be in a recession,378.34,397.70001,393.26999,6,2023,1

Even after its latest dip, Nvidia is trading at 23 times estimated sales for the current year. That compares with less than 15 times for both Lattice Semiconductor Corp., which has the second-highest valuation on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, and C3.ai, the small cap whose ticker is “AI”.
The AI faithful are unlikely to be shaken by a few down days, however. Nvidia co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, whose personal fortune has grown by $20 billion this year according to data compiled by Bloomberg, says companies that refuse to take full advantage of the opportunities provided by AI “will perish”.
Nvidia has 49 buy recommendations, more than all but four stocks on the Nasdaq 100.

The hottest thing in technology is an unprepossessing sliver of silicon closely related to the chips that power video game graphics. It’s an artificial intelligence chip, designed specifically to make building AI systems such as ChatGPT faster and cheaper.
Such chips have suddenly taken center stage in what some experts consider an AI revolution that could reshape the technology sector — and possibly the world along with it. Shares of Nvidia, the leading designer of AI chips, rocketed up almost 25% last Thursday after the company forecast a huge jump in revenue that analysts said indicated soaring sales of its products. The company was briefly worth more than $1 trillion on Tuesday.
SO WHAT ARE AI CHIPS, ANYWAY?
That isn't an easy question to answer. “There really isn’t a completely agreed upon definition of AI chips,"" said Hannah Dohmen, a research analyst with the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.
In general, though, the term encompasses computing hardware that's specialized to handle AI workloads — for instance, by “training” AI systems to tackle difficult problems that can choke conventional computers.
VIDEO GAME ORIGINS
Three entrepreneurs founded Nvidia in 1993 to push the boundaries of computational graphics. Within a few years, the company had developed a new chip called a graphics processing unit, or GPU, which dramatically sped up both development and play of video games by performing multiple complex graphics calculations at once.
That technique, known formally as parallel processing, would prove key to the development of both games and AI. Two graduate students at the University of Toronto used a GPU-based neural network to win a prestigious 2012 AI competition called ImageNet by identifying photo images at much lower error rates than competitors.
The win kick-started interest in AI-related parallel processing, opening a new business opportunity for Nvidia and its rivals while providing researchers powerful tools for exploring the frontiers of AI development.
MODERN AI CHIPS
Eleven years later, Nvidia is the dominant supplier of chips for building and updating AI systems. One of its recent products, the H100 GPU, packs in 80 billion transistors — about 13 million more than Apple's latest high-end processor for its MacBook Pro laptop. Unsurprisingly, this technology isn't cheap; at one online retailer, the H100 lists for $30,000.
Nvidia doesn't fabricate these complex GPU chips itself, a task that would require enormous investments in new factories. Instead it relies on Asian chip foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Korea's Samsung Electronics.
Some of the biggest customers for AI chips are cloud-computing services such as those run by Amazon and Microsoft. By renting out their AI computing power, those services make it possible for smaller companies and groups that couldn't afford to build their own AI systems from scratch to use cloud-based tools to help with tasks that can range from drug discovery to customer management.
OTHER USES AND COMPETITION
Parallel processing has many uses outside of AI. A few years ago, for instance, Nvidia graphics cards were in short supply because cryptocurrency miners, who set up banks of computers to solve thorny mathematical problems for bitcoin rewards, had snapped up most of them.

The company reported first quarter revenues of $72.4 million, more than the $71 million expected on an adjusted loss per share of $0.13, less than the $0.17 loss analysts had expected.
C3.ai's full-year revenue outlook, however, appeared to come in shy of Wall Street expectations. The company said it expects revenue for its fiscal year 2024 to be between $295-$320 million; data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed analysts were looking for revenues closer to $321 million for the full year.
And after AI plays like Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) last week significantly raised their forecasts on a surge in demand, investors appear to be harshly judging C3.ai, with the stock down more than 15% in early trading Thursday.
""We believe it is generally agreed today that the market for enterprise AI applications is substantially larger and growing at a much greater growth rate than experts predicted,"" the company said in a statement.
""C3 AI has been at the vanguard of the enterprise AI market for over a decade as that market has developed from its roots in IoT, to unsupervised learning, supervised learning, NLP, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI.""
Despite those assurances, though, investors weren't impressed with C3.ai's outlook.
AI is the hottest trend on Wall Street, as companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell (MRVL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) ride the hype wave that kicked off with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.
And while shares of AI darling Nvidia are up 162% since the start of 2023, C3.ai's stock is up a whopping 252%.
C3.ai produces enterprise AI software used by a wide range of industries including transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. On Tuesday, the firm announced that its own C3 Generative AI product is available via Amazon's AWS marketplace. It is already available via Google's Cloud Marketplace.
Unlike generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, C3.ai's offering is specifically designed for enterprise settings. To that end it allows users to access corporate data via a natural language interface while preventing users from accidentally sharing that information with the outside world.

The bar was high for C3.ai considering that its stock price has soared 258% year-to-date heading into its earnings results.
While the company beat its quarterly revenue and profit estimate by $1.1 million and 4 cents per share, it offered investors underwhelming guidance and didn't follow Nvidia's footsteps by significantly increasing its revenue guidance.
C3.ai said it expects total revenue of up to $72.5 million in its upcoming quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $71.3 million. For its full fiscal 2024 year, C3.ai said it expects up to $320 million in revenue and adjusted losses from operations of up to $75 million.

The AI investment frenzy on Wall Street led Nvidia's valuation to swell by $248 billion in May.
A large swath of businesses that drive nearly half of US economic activity is leaning into artificial intelligence, as valuations of AI-linked stocks have swelled by hundreds of billions of dollars in the equity market.
""Small businesses are AI-curious,"" American Express said about the results of its recently released survey of 550 small business leaders.
The survey, which ran in March, showed that 41% of small businesses are prioritizing AI to help them make decisions. The online query found 39% of respondents were using AI tools for time-saving purposes and 20% were aiming for customer-service efficiency.
There is also a generational divide: 56% small businesses run by Gen-Zers and Millennials are prioritizing AI regardless of their operational size versus 24% among older generations.
The findings come as Wall Street is in the midst of an investment frenzy set off by last year's introduction of natural-language chatbot ChatGPT.
Stronger demand for AI products and prospects for the technology has prompted stock investors to pour billions of dollars into shares of chipmaker Nvidia and other companies this year.
Nvidia stock has surged 159% during 2023, and in May alone, Nvidia's market capitalization jumped by $248 billion, outpacing gains among the top 20 global companies by market value, according to Reuters, citing Refinitiv data. This week, Nvidia stepped into a small club of companies valued at $1 trillion or more.
Other Big Tech companies with AI tools are also seeing their market caps leap. Valuations of Google parent Alphabet and OpenAI investor Microsoft last month increased by $195 billion and $157 billion, respectively.
But AI stocks have jumped so much that some on Wall Street think it's time to reduce risk and capture some profits.
""We will be trimming a great deal of our profits in AI-related stocks over the next few weeks, as many of these stocks are up over 100% so far this year,"" Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, said in a note Thursday.

The shares rose as much as 6% Friday, and are poised for a jump of about 18% on the week. Jefferies provided the latest spark, upgrading SoftBank to buy from hold, saying it is a “likely beneficiary” of the frenzy in recent stocks following Nvidia Corp.’s bullish sales forecast last month.
Investor enthusiasm for all things AI in the wake of ChatGPT’s launch late last year has driven huge gains in related stocks globally. Nvidia earlier this week became the first chipmaker to reach a $1 trillion market valuation.
SoftBank plans to list its Arm Ltd. chip-design unit on Nasdaq this year, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg. The world’s largest technology investor is testing the market’s appetite for raising as much as $10 billion in the IPO, Bloomberg has reported. SoftBank has not publicly confirmed its choice of exchange, although it did disclose that Arm filed confidentially for a New York offering.
“Arm will be positioned as an AI play into the IPO,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. Goyal assumes $60 billion as a “base case” valuation for Arm.
Jefferies became at least the third financial firm to upgrade SoftBank to buy in the past three weeks, following Morningstar and HSBC. The stock now has 18 buy recommendations versus five holds and no sells.
SoftBank Group has said it is keen to ramp up investments in AI, though big losses on holdings in recent quarters that drove the company’s stock down have made it cautious. Masayoshi Son’s flagship’s existing investment in Arm is now providing it with a key way to ride the theme.
Arm’s chief executive officer, Rene Haas, highlighted AI in a keynote address at a trade conference in Taiwan earlier this week. SoftBank’s Japanese telecommunications unit also announced a tie-up with Nvidia on a platform for generative AI and 5G/6G applications using Arm-based chips.

The shares rose as much as 6% Friday, and are poised for a jump of about 18% on the week. Jefferies provided the latest spark, upgrading SoftBank to buy from hold, saying it is a “likely beneficiary” of the frenzy in recent stocks following Nvidia Corp.’s bullish sales forecast last month.
Investor enthusiasm for all things AI in the wake of ChatGPT’s launch late last year has driven huge gains in related stocks globally. Nvidia earlier this week became the first chipmaker to reach a $1 trillion market valuation.
SoftBank plans to list its Arm Ltd. chip-design unit on Nasdaq this year, people familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg. The world’s largest technology investor is testing the market’s appetite for raising as much as $10 billion in the IPO, Bloomberg has reported. SoftBank has not publicly confirmed its choice of exchange, although it did disclose that Arm filed confidentially for a New York offering.
“Arm will be positioned as an AI play into the IPO,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. Goyal assumes $60 billion as a “base case” valuation for Arm.
Jefferies became at least the third financial firm to upgrade SoftBank to buy in the past three weeks, following Morningstar and HSBC. The stock now has 18 buy recommendations versus five holds and no sells.
SoftBank Group has said it is keen to ramp up investments in AI, though big losses on holdings in recent quarters that drove the company’s stock down have made it cautious. Masayoshi Son’s flagship’s existing investment in Arm is now providing it with a key way to ride the theme.
Arm’s chief executive officer, Rene Haas, highlighted AI in a keynote address at a trade conference in Taiwan earlier this week. SoftBank’s Japanese telecommunications unit also announced a tie-up with Nvidia on a platform for generative AI and 5G/6G applications using Arm-based chips.

Rajiv Jain, founder and chief investment officer of GQG Partners, said Silicon Valley-based technology manufacturer, whose products power AI applications including ChatGPT, will be one of only a few US stocks that remain in positive territory after the markets’ recent rebound.
Nvidia became the first chipmaker to hit a $1tn valuation this week as investors stampeded into companies that are seen as the biggest beneficiaries from developments in AI.
Its shares have soared 170pc this year, adding $575bn to the group’s market capitalisation, with GQG buying $2.3bn of shares in the first quarter and since adding to its stake.
Mr Jain told the Financial Times: “In Nvidia’s context, it [AI] is going to create some winners and losers . . . more losers than winners.
“The most obvious winners at this point, besides Nvidia, will be the larger tech names, whether it’s Alphabet or Meta or these kinds of names.”

AI surge leaves 'FOMO kicking in' on stock market
Retail traders are riding the wave of AI mania that has swamped Wall Street, looking beyond Nvidia and C3.ai for the next stocks to pop, according to analysts.
“FOMO looks to be kicking in,” according to Vanda’s Marco Iachini, who said individual investors are now looking beyond the large-cap stocks which were initial targets.
The day-trading crowd has piled into the likes of Palantir Technologies, Marvell Technology and UiPath, pushing in millions over the past week, data from Vanda Research show.
That comes as the trio rallies in the wake of Nvidia’s blowout results.
However, retail traders are still snapping up shares of Nvidia, having plowed $285m into the company over a five-day span.

Good morning
Nvidia may have seen its shares surge by 170pc this year, briefly making it the first $1trn chipmaker, but one of its major backers have issued a warning about the boom on the stock market triggered by excitement about artificial intelligence.
Rajiv Jain, founder and chief investment officer of GQG Partners, said AI would “create more losers than winners”.
He predicted Nvidia will be one of only a few US stocks that remain in positive territory after the markets recent rebound.

What happened overnight
Asian stocks advanced, led by gains in Hong Kong-listed technology companies amid a buoyant tone in markets after the US passed legislation to avoid a debt default and as traders look to the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases in June.
Shares also climbed in Japan, Australia and mainland China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose more than 3pc, pulling the benchmark back from the brink of a bear market following concerns about Chinese growth.
US indexes ticked up in after-hours trading, following rallies for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. News that Congress had passed legislation to avert a US default added to the buoyant mood.
Wall Street stocks had closed higher before the vote was passed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.5pc to 33,062.36, while the broad-based S&P 500 closed 1pc higher at 4,221.09.
The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index surged 1.3pc to 13,100.98.
Treasury yields retreated as fresh inflation data signalled that the US central bank could pause its interest rate increases, after prices paid in the manufacturing sector declined last month.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.60pc from 3.65pc late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which is more sensitive to expectations for the Federal Reserve, fell to 4.33pc from 4.40pc.","AI will 'create more losers than winners,' says major investor in chipmaker Nvidia - latest updates",397.70001,393.26999,391.70999,6,2023,2

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management’s overweight on Nvidia, a position held since at least the end of 2020, is now “far smaller,” according to global chief investment officer Benjamin Melman. The money manager took some profits in the recent rally that briefly sent the company’s market cap above $1 trillion last week.
“Would we add to AI tech? We’re less and less sure on that as valuations are too lofty,” Melman said in an interview. His firm has 79 billion francs ($87.1 billion) in assets under management. “If the gains continue, we’ll be even more cautious.”
An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.
The buzz around AI propelled the Nasdaq 100 to its best May returns since 2005, and tech stocks are beating other industry groups in the S&P 500 by the most on record. The sector has also gotten a a boost from bets the Federal Reserve will stop hiking rates.
The pace of the rally has prompted some caution among strategists. BofA’s Michael Hartnett said AI is in a “baby bubble,” after tech funds attracted record inflows in the week through May 31. And Citigroup Inc.’s Chris Montagu has said positioning risks are biased toward profit taking in the Nasdaq 100.
Melman is still optimistic about the theme more broadly, seeing opportunities in companies that provide the data to power AI. He declined to mention specific stocks, but said they were spread across sectors such as banks, insurance and radiology.

NVDA,2023-06-02 19:21:45,"In a recent tweet, Graham said he believes all the good AI companies to invest in are still private, which leaves few options for the public markets","In a recent tweet, Graham said he believes all the good AI companies to invest in are still private.
This, he said, leaves few options for those public market investors wanting to invest in AI.
But some claim those wanting to invest in AI can buy stocks of companies like Nvidia or Microsoft.
Paul Graham says public market investors are missing out on a potential way to get in on the AI boom, since all the good companies to invest in are still private.
The famed venture capitalist, entrepreneur and cofounder of startup accelerator Y Combinator tweeted that those who invest in the public markets – which includes anyone who can access a stock trading account on Robinhood or Charles Schwab – have few options if they want to invest in an AI company.
Graham argues that AI is the ""first big wave of technology"" since startups started going public later, which results in ""a unique problem.""
Since many AI startups are still relatively new – most have been founded within the past five years or so – they rely mainly on private funding from investors like venture capitalists or private-equity firms to fund their operations and help them grow over time. The everyday retail investor probably doesn't have the kind of cash or access to invest in these companies directly.
And the typical pathway to the public stock market can take several years and most AI companies haven't achieved the type of scale and revenue necessary to make the transition to that market. It's also not a great time for a company to go public. The current volatile state of the IPO market makes it less appealing, even for the biggest and most successful private companies, like payments giant Stripe or grocery delivery startup Instacart, to go public.
This is the unique problem that Graham references and he believes there are only two ways to satisfy the public demand for AI companies: an already public company will ""claim"" they are now an AI company by buying an AI startup or AI startups will hit the public markets much quicker than expected.
Neither scenario, according to Graham, may produce a good investment since those companies choosing the first route are playing to public market opinion, while those settling for the second could probably find a private investor willing to give them the kind of capital they're looking for.
But some disagree with Graham's assessment, arguing that a public stock market investor could buy into companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet or Meta, and get the kind of AI investing exposure they seek.
AI-related stocks have soared on the public markets this year, but new research from Vanda Research shows that institutional investors are driving the upswing. Retail investors, however, ""remain on the sidelines"" the research firm said in its note.
Nvidia, the public company originally known for producing computer chips that power things like graphics for computer games, now also produces chips that power generative AI, where users can create text and images with simple prompts. It's the technology that underpins applications like ChatGPT, Google's Bard and others. Wall Street recently took notice and helped catapult the company's worth briefly to $1 trillion, joining other big tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet in that club.
And Microsoft has plans to pump $10 billion into AI startup OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT and DALL-E, and is integrating the company's technology into many of its tools. While Google has an AI chatbot of its own called Bard. And, these big tech companies have venture arms of their own that invest in AI startups. For instance, Google recently led a $100 million round in generative AI startup, Runway, Insider reported.
Yet, private investing in AI startup innovations may be where the biggest potential for a huge windfall, as Graham alludes to. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the masses last fall, investors have been keenly interested in AI, and specifically, generative AI.
In the first quarter alone this year, generative AI startups raked in about $1.7 billion in VC funding, according to PitchBook data, and that doesn't even account for an additional $10.7 billion worth of deals that were announced but haven't closed.
Three years ago during the same quarter, data shows the funding was just $250 million.",Y Combinator founder Paul Graham thinks stock market investors are missing out on the AI boom,397.70001,393.26999,391.70999,6,2023,2

""If You Use NVIDIA's Chips, You Can Speak In The Vernacular Of ChatGPT""
Avid viewers of Jim Cramer's Mad Money on CNBC will not be surprised to hear that Cramer is a huge fan of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On May 26, the Mad Money host recounted the shock felt by everyone monitoring the chipmaking and artificial intelligence sectors caused by NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ""spectacular beat"" in the first quarter of 2023. The company reported an adjusted EPS of $1.09 while the market had expected $0.92, making this a beat of $0.17. Revenues for the chipmaker also exceeded expectations, coming in at $7.19 billion, beating estimates by $669.47 million. Cramer noted that:
""Moore's Law Is Dead""
While going over the potential NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) harnesses, Cramer mentioned Moore's law, a theory that implies that ""chips will double in power every two years."" This is a rule that has been governing the chip space for decades, placing limitations on what chip-makers can do. However, according to Cramer, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Huang had told him years ago that ""Moore's law was dead."" He made this claim on the basis of the fact that ""he came up with a way to make graphics cards that were more powerful and even more efficient, even if they were bigger because there was increasingly no benefit to shrinking semiconductors.""
Because of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) undeniable success and its superior chips, major big tech companies have begun relying on it alone for their chips, especially if artificial intelligence is a space they wish to venture into. This preference for the company may very well stem from the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) seems to have ""zero competition in the chip space,"" as Cramer himself noted.
""You Stray, You Lose""
But apart from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cramer is also heavily bullish on many other companies, such as ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY). In another Mad Money episode that aired May 31, Cramer went through several S&P 500 sectors, sifting through the winners and the losers for his audience to be better prepared for this market. He noted that the S&P 500 technology sector has been winning in May, rising by 34.81% year-to-date as of May 31. The communications services sector also managed to pull through, rising by 32.25% over the same period. The consumer discretionary sector was also a winner, rising by 19.25% year-to-date as of May 31.
While going through the winners of 2023 so far, Cramer noted that these sectors included companies that ""are a who's who of artificial intelligence and friends,"" implying that those sectors that didn't stray from the ""tech complex"" managed to rise and continue rising all through May. On the flip side, we have the losing sectors which Cramer uses as examples of ""what happens if you do stray from tech."" Losers in the S&P 500 include the energy sector, down 11.23% year-to-date as of May 31. Cramer stated that ""oil and natural gas have been terrible investments this year.""
Over the same period, the utilities sector declined by 9.38%. This sector's downfall, in particular, may shock many investors since it offers primarily dividend stocks. However, Cramer notes that ""these dividends now look less attractive versus bonds."" Even the healthcare sector hasn't managed to make it out of May unscathed, falling by 7.05% year-to-date as of May 31. The financials sector has also seen its fair share of declines this year, being down 6.48% over the same period, ""led by Comerica, KeyBanc, and Zions. Finally, Cramer notes that the fifth-worst performing sector in the S&P 500 by May was real estate, being down 3.55% year-to-date. These were merely the worst five sectors within the S&P 500 so far, but their examples seem enough to drive home the point that Cramer is trying to make: investing in tech is a must in 2023.

NVDA,2023-06-02 20:13:00,"The ChatGPT-fueled ""baby bubble"" has become the dominant theme for markets, strategist Michael Hartnett said in a research note.","Investors poured a record $8.5 billion of cash into tech funds last week, Bank of America found.
They're piling into the sector with the Nasdaq Composite on a tear, up 25% year-to-date.
The AI ""baby bubble"" has become the dominant theme for markets, strategist Michael Hartnett said.
Investors are piling more cash into tech stocks than ever before thanks to the artificial intelligence craze, according to Bank of America.
Tech funds brought in a record $8.5 billion in the week ending May 31, the bank found.
AI is probably fueling inflows into the sector, a team led by strategist Michael Hartnett said in a note to clients on Friday.
The explosion of interest in ChatGPT at the start of the year ignited an AI frenzy for investors, with big names like Bill Ackman and Stanley Druckenmiller loading up on related stocks.
That's driven a tech boom, with the Nasdaq Composite index up 25% in 2023 and blue-chip names Nvidia and Meta racking up triple-digit returns in the first five months of the year.
There's a risk the tech rally will fizzle out soon, according to Hartnett, with technical analyses suggesting the sector may be overbought.
The strategist has previously said there could be an AI ""baby bubble"" that echoes the excessive valuations of internet-related stocks in the early 2000s before the dot-com crash.
He said in Friday's note that he's still bearish on equities as an asset class, with the Federal Reserve potentially revving up for further interest-rate hikes later this year as it presses ahead with its war on inflation.
Stocks tend to fall when rates rise because investors are able to get higher returns by parking their cash in government bonds and savings accounts.
Tech companies' share prices tend to take a particular hit because their valuations are often reliant on borrowing cash — which becomes more expensive when the Fed tightens — and price in their future growth, which might be slower if the wider economy cools.

Jennison Associates' nearly 1% stake in the microchip maker is worth around $8.6 billion today.
Nvidia shares have surged by about 160% this year as investors bet it will profit from the AI boom.
A secretive US asset manager has likely notched a $5 billion gain on Nvidia this year, making it one of the biggest winners from the microchip maker's epic stock rally.
Jennison Associates owned roughly 23 million Nvidia shares at the end of last year and at the end of March this year, regulatory filings show. The position jumped in value from $3.4 billion to $6.3 billion in the first quarter as Nvidia's stock price soared. It would be now worth an astounding $8.6 billion, based on Thursday's closing price.
The growth equity manager's nearly 1% stake in Nvidia ranks it among the company's 10 largest shareholders, per CNN Business. Meanwhile, Jennison counts Nvidia among its largest holdings; the position accounted for 3.5% of its roughly $100 billion US stock portfolio at the end of December, and 5.8% at the end of March.
Jennison, which keeps a low profile and rarely engages with the media, has owned Nvidia shares on and off since at least the fourth quarter of 2001 - less than two years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took his company public.
Nvidia's stock price has skyrocketed by about 160% this year, as investors wager the semiconductor giant will play a pivotal role in the artificial-intelligence boom. The company's shares surged 24% on Thursday, boosting its market capitalization to over $900 billion, after it issued a second-quarter sales forecast that smashed Wall Street's expectations.
Jennison — which has offices in New York and Boston —has bet heavily on Big Tech. It owned over $7 billion of Microsoft stock at the end of March, nearly $7 billion of Apple, and more than $4 billion worth of both Amazon and Tesla. Together with Nvidia, those were its top five US stock holdings at the end of March.
It's worth emphasizing that portfolio updates only provide a snapshot of a firm's holdings on a particular day. They also exclude overseas-listed stocks, private investments, non-stock assets, and shares sold short.
Therefore, it's possible that Jennison has significantly altered its Nvidia stake since the end of March, or its massive gain on paper has been offset by hedges or losses elsewhere in its portfolio.

NVDA,2023-06-05 22:02:01,"AI is expected to boost productivity, which would be huge for stocks as the market faces a bunch of other pressure points.","AI is all the rage in the stock market right now.
AI-affiliated mega-cap stocks like Nvidia have been backstopping a market facing a series of headwinds.
It's a push-and-pull relationship that could define stocks over the next decade.
The surge in interest around artificial intelligence triggered by the sudden popularity of ChatGPT has created trillions of dollars of stock market value.
Nvidia is the leader in the clubhouse so far this year, having spiked more than 175% to join the $1 trillion club, while Meta is also up 119%. Juggernauts like Alphabet and Microsoft have seen returns approach 40%. This is all happening as the US economy lumbers towards a recession and Congress plays a game of chicken with the nation's debt limit.
It's exactly what the stock market has needed to stay afloat as headwinds — including an earnings slowdown and elevated interest rates — have continued to pile up. The S&P 500 is basically flat since the beginning of April, with the AI hype helping to offset multiple economic challenges.
This push and pull is indicative of a battle that will likely play out over the next decade. As negative forces combine to drag stocks lower, it's increasingly looking like AI can be the bright spot that offsets that.
There are two core elements in play: the productivity boost that widespread AI adoption is supposed to drive, and the resulting positive impact on profit margins, which are the primary driver of stock gains.
AI is expected to increase productivity
The case for an AI-led productivity boom isn't just being led by stock bulls. Academic researchers have also reached the same conclusion.
A recent study from Stanford and MIT found that workers at a Fortune 500 software company who were given generative AI tools got 14% more productive. Those gains approached 30% for the least experienced workers.
""The system appears to create value by capturing and conveying some of the tacit organizational knowledge about how to solve problems and please customers that previously was learned only via on-the-job experience,"" reads a Brookings Institute summary of the report.
Some of the world's most renowned investors and market pundits are also on board. Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones says the stunning mainstream popularity of AI has made him reevaluate his forecasts for inflation and the stock market.
""The introduction of large language models [and] artificial intelligence is going to create a productivity boom that we've only seen a few times in the last 75 years,"" Jones said in a recent CNBC interview.
Market veteran Ed Yardeni — who previously served as chief investment strategist for Oak Associates, Prudential Equity Group, and Deutsche Bank — thinks AI-driven productivity has the potential to start a new prolonged bull cycle for stocks.
""This may be the event that launches the Roaring 2020s,"" he wrote in a blog post a couple weeks ago. ""If so, then we can spend a lot less time obsessing about what the Fed will do next and focus on how technology is boosting productivity and the standard of living throughout the economy.""
The crucial role of margin growth
To understand how this increase in productivity will translate to stock gains, one must first look at profit margins and the role they play in share-price appreciation. In order to do that, you have to go back decades.
Over the last 30-plus years, US companies have enjoyed immense growth in profit margins. Since 1990, they've more than doubled.
That's been largely responsible for a more than 1,100% increase in the S&P 500 over that period. After all, earnings growth has historically been the biggest driver of share gains, and margins are a reflecton of how efficiently companies convert sales to actual profit. And as the green line in the chart below shows, it hasn't been limited to tech titans:
But amid a broad economic slowdown, margins have trended downward, and look poised to continue lower. Goldman Sachs finds that margins have declined by a full percentage point in recent quarters, and expects a 36-basis-point dip for full-year 2023.
This decline is poised to hamper the S&P 500's ability to continue generating returns in line with its historical trend. That's because margin expansion has been the market's ace in the hole as revenue and GDP growth have slowed. Without that support, Goldman says stocks will fall below their long term average.
AI's impact on margins
This is where AI comes back in and ties it all together. According to Goldman, generative AI will boost US productivity growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points per year over a 10-year period. The firm expects that, in turn, to result in a 4-percentage-point increase in S&P 500 net profit margins.
That's basically pure rocket fuel for stock returns, and it could be what keeps the S&P 500 backstopped as other positive catalysts evaporate. This chart shows the clear relationship between improving productivity growth leading to higher margins.
As with any fast-appreciating area of the market, AI stocks are not without their naysayers.
A recent research note from Bank of America called this cohort a ""baby bubble,"" noting that it started under easy-money conditions and will likely end amid tightening.
And while AI may ultimately end up being hugely powerful in the long term, the firm notes that asset prices could still deflate significantly from current levels. The rise of the internet, after all, was technically a bubble.
Semantics aside, only time will tell whether how the AI revolution will separate the winners who implement it from the losers who get disrupted by it. Regardless of how that shakes out, there's no denying that AI has the potential to be a key driver of the overall market for years to come.",How AI could save the stock market,393.26999,391.70999,386.54001,6,2023,5

The massive artificial intelligence-driven rally in tech stocks may already be fading, and further rises in US interest rates could lead to a major correction in the stock market, according to Julian Howard, head of multi-asset solutions at GAM Investments.
Investors are facing a ""laundry list"" of problems including high inflation and borrowing costs, and it might be more appropriate for them to ""wait it out"" rather than take on significant risk exposure under current conditions, Howard told CNBC on Monday.
AI-focused tech shares such as Nvidia have outperformed the market this year, following the smashing debut of OpenAI's language tool ChatGPT. The chipmaker's stock, however, has retreated by close to 8% in the past week, paring its year-to-date advance to about 165%.
""I think there's a big risk around...the price of money, the reaction function of the Fed, higher rates...that hasn't gone away. It could actually get worse for the market,"" Howard said.
""The AI tech trade starts to fade in the latter half of last week, I think that could continue. Long duration assets like technology stocks – they are the most sensitive to the price of money, to the prevailing discount rate – and in fact, the discount rate starts to tick up as investors feel that actually the Fed isn't done after all,"" Howard said.
That could lead to a 'quite a sizable correction,' according to him.
The Fed has hiked benchmark rates by 500 basis points since early 2022 to contain inflation that hit 40-year highs last summer. Higher borrowing costs tend to reduce demand and pull down asset prices.
Further rate hikes would ramp up discount rates, leading to lower future cash flows. That could particularly weigh on mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market's rally since the beginning of 2023 - with the S&P 500 gaining 11% and the Nasdaq Composite advancing 26% so far this year.
It's time for the market to refocus on the risks posed by high inflation and rates, according Howard.
""The U.S. consumer is pretty ambivalent about inflation, it kind of expects higher inflation now, and that's dangerous because that entrenches higher inflation itself, because obviously expectations lead to higher inflation,"" he said.","AI tech trade may be fading and the stock market could face 'a sizable correction' if interest rates rise further, GAM Investments fund manager says",386.54001,374.75,385.10001,6,2023,7

""Now that the latest fiscal cliff has been averted, is another MAMU underway led by stocks that are AI frenzy plays? Maybe,"" he said

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investor Stanley Druckenmiller, chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Duquesne Family Office, said on Wednesday that he still expects a hard landing for the U.S. economy, as inflation persists, but offered a positive outlook for Nvidia.

The proliferate of AI technologies should help productivity and profits rise, the bank said.
""We estimate the benefit to S&P 500 fair value could be as small at +5% and as large as +14%,"" Goldman said.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to drive the stock market considerably higher as more companies adopt the technology and see its benefits, according to Goldman Sachs.
The bank said as companies adopt AI technology, both productivity and corporate profits should rise enough to drive the stock market up as little as 5% from current levels or as much as 14%, which would send the S&P 500 to record highs at 4,884. The potential stock market upside depends on profitability gains sparked by AI.
The first example of AI pushing the stock market higher played out with Nvidia on May 29, when the company's stock soared more than 30% after it said demand for its AI chips would drive a surge in its revenue and profits.
""The AI-inspired demand for Nvidia's advanced chips is accelerating so rapidly that the consensus sales forecast published earlier this year is now totally obsolete,"" Goldman Sachs' Ryan Hammond said.
If more companies can harness the power and potential efficiency gains from AI, then more and more companies could see profit boosts that ultimately send their stock prices higher.
""Our economists estimate that following widespread adoption generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by roughly 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period,"" Hammond said, adding that two factors would increase the output of the US economy.
First, employees who are partially exposed to AI and automation should be able to direct their newly freed-up capacity towards other productive activities.
Second, workers who are displaced by AI and automation will eventually become reemployed, boosting total output in new jobs that emerge following AI adoption.
""Increased economy-wide output could translate into increased revenues and earnings for S&P 500 companies, even beyond those firms directly involved in the development of AI,"" Hammond said.
And the upside in AI isn't limited to companies that make chips that enable the technology, like Nvidia. Instead, companies across different sectors could benefit from AI.
""Every company could theoretically utilize the generative algorithms to improve productivity and profitability. The relatively stable share of revenues allocated to selling, general, and administrative expenses in recent decades, in contrast with large declines in other input costs, highlights the potential gain to profitability from AI,"" he said.
But there are also risks to Goldman's forecast that could limit potential upside. Aside from it being incredibly difficult to predict the future productivity gains sparked by AI, the government could also limit them.
""One potential policy response could include an increased corporate minimum tax rate, as was recently introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act. The S&P 500 effective tax rate would need to rise from 20% today to roughly 28% in 20 years to offset the potential earnings boost from AI adoption, all else equal,"" Hammond explained.
He also highlighted that the dot-com bubble serves as a warning to investors to not get expectations too high about the future potential of AI, as they may ultimately be disappointed.
""During the late 1990s, while many of the largest [technology, media, and telecom] stocks continued to grow sales, their inability to meet optimistic investor expectations led to a collapse in valuations,"" Hammond warned.","The stock market could surge 14% as companies adopt AI to boost productivity and profits, Goldman Sachs says",386.54001,374.75,385.10001,6,2023,7

However, advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and the tantalizing long-term opportunity that this technology presents, have reignited investor enthusiasm for this sector of the market, as investors increasingly appreciate the fact that semiconductors are fueling the AI revolution.
After Nvidia’s blowout first-quarter earnings call (more on that later), sell-side analysts from Susquehanna called AI the “new gold rush” and hailed Nvidia as the company selling the picks and shovels for it. Nvidia is dominating the headlines right now, and rightfully so, but remember that there are also other chip stocks providing these AI “picks and shovels,” including Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices.
One way to invest in these picks-and-shovels plays collectively is with a concentrated semiconductor ETF like the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ). Therefore, let’s take a look at this semiconductor-centric ETF that gives investors significant exposure to these leading semiconductor companies.
What is SOXQ ETF?
SOXQ is a relatively small $128 million ETF from Invesco that invests in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of the 30 largest U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks; it encompasses all parts of the semiconductor supply chain, including companies “engaged in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of semiconductors,” according to Invesco. The index and fund are reconstituted on an annual basis and rebalanced quarterly.
With investor enthusiasm for AI and semiconductors surging, it’s perhaps unsurprising that SOXQ is up 38% year-to-date. The ETF only launched in 2021, so it doesn’t have much of a long-term track record.
SOXQ also features a very reasonable expense ratio of just 0.19%. This means that an investor putting $10,000 into SOXQ would pay just $19 in fees over the first year. This expense ratio compares favorably to that of some of the most popular semiconductor ETFs on the market, like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which both have expense ratios of 0.35%.
Its also far cheaper than some of the notable AI-specific ETFs out there, like the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ) or the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ), which have higher expense ratios of 0.69% and 0.75%, respectively. Investing in ETFs with low fees helps you to preserve the value of your portfolio over time.
SOXQ’s Holdings
SOXQ is not particularly diversified — it has only 31 holdings, and its top 10 holdings account for 64.5% of the fund. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for undiluted exposure to semiconductors and names like Nvidia, AMD, and Marvell, to name a few, this isn’t necessarily a problem.
SOXQ gives investors significant exposure to these AI leaders. Nvidia is the fund’s top holding, with an 11.2% weighting.
At this point, even the most casual investor is likely aware of Nvidia’s day for the ages when it reported blowout earnings. Nvidia, which had already more than doubled in price in 2023 and was one of the largest companies in the world by market cap, added almost $184 billion to its market cap in one day with a 24% gain, falling just shy of the largest single-day gain in market cap in history.
Nvidia forecasted current quarter sales of approximately $11 billion, a 64% increase year over year, blowing out analyst estimates of $7.2 billion. CEO Jensen Huang says that generative AI applications like ChatGPT are driving demand for its chips, as these types of applications require substantial computing power.
ChatGPT was only unveiled to the public last November, but it quickly became a sensation, hitting over 100 million users in just two months on its way to becoming the fastest-growing application of all time. The aforementioned Susquehanna analysts marveled at the fact that the virality of these applications is already translating into increased orders for Nvidia, calling it “unimaginable.”
AMD isn’t far behind Nvidia, with a 10.8% weighting in SOXQ. AMD has its own lineup of AI chips, and analysts from Morgan Stanley recently acknowledged that AMD’s AI opportunity may be much more substantial than they initially forecasted. Analysts from the investment bank said that they initially expected AMD to have AI revenue of $100 million in 2024 but that they could generate as much as $400 million, or even $1.2 billion, in a bull case scenario.
Beyond these two juggernauts, SOXQ is composed of a who’s who of other top semiconductor companies. Broadcom is the third-largest holding with a 9.1% weighting. Texas Instruments, which makes the analog chips that are crucial for all digital devices, comes in fourth with a 6.9% position.
You’ll also find semiconductor fabricators like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML Holding, which are cornerstones of the semiconductor supply chain and manufacture chips for the likes of Nvidia and AMD. Lam Research, also represented here with a 4.3% weighting, makes and services equipment that is needed for the manufacturing of semiconductors. You can almost think of these types of companies as the picks-and-shovels providers to the picks-and-shovels providers.
Lastly, the aforementioned Marvell makes up 4% of the fund. Marvell saw Nvidia’s blowout results and historic gain and said, “Hold my beer” when it reported earnings. In other words, shares of Marvell surged almost 30% for the day. On its call, Marvell broke out AI-related revenue and said that revenue from its AI business was $200 million last year. It expects AI revenue to double each of the next two fiscal years.
Below, you can view SOXQ’s top 10 holdings.
What is the Price Target for SOXQ Stock?
Analysts collectively view SOXQ as a Moderate Buy, but the average SOXQ stock price target of $29.70 implies upside potential of ~8% from current prices. Of the 442 analyst ratings on SOXQ, 68.35% are Buy ratings, 27.52% are Holds, and 4.13% are Sells.
Additionally, SOXQ has an impressive ETF Smart Score of 8. As this is an article about semiconductors and AI, it’s only right to take a look at how quantitative, non-human models view SOXQ.
The Smart Score is TipRanks’ proprietary quantitative stock scoring system that evaluates stocks on eight different market factors. The result is data-driven and does not require any human intervention. A Smart Score of 8 or above is the equivalent of an Outperform rating.
Looking Ahead
In conclusion, SOXQ is a strong, low-cost way to get exposure to the picks-and-shovels plays that will continue to benefit from the AI megatrend. It’s hard to argue that companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Marvell won’t be key players in advancing this technology for years to come.
In the short term, all of these stocks are making new 52-week highs, and it’s likely that some of them will pull back at some point. On the other hand, I also wouldn’t want to not have exposure to these names, as AI is clearly here to stay and is just getting started on disrupting many industries.
Thus, my strategy (not financial advice) with an ETF like this would be to start a position now to get a foothold in this part of the market and then to dollar cost average over time on pullbacks on my way to building a full position.",SOXQ ETF: Front-Row Exposure to Semiconductor Stocks and AI,386.54001,374.75,385.10001,6,2023,7

VC funding globally shook out to nearly $22 billion in May 2023, the data reveals. While that marks a slight uptick month-over-month, it's still a jarring year-over-over decline of 44%. This funding drop comes despite a surge of investments in AI-focused companies.
The AI hype is high, to be sure, and it traces back to the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which gained widespread public recognition in late 2022. In the public markets, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and C3AI (AI) have seen their shares skyrocket, and, in Nvidia's case, it's been a monumental shift – the chipmaker is now careening towards and around a trillion-dollar market cap.
The AI hype has, predictably, translated to funding on a VC level – to an extent. There's good news, to be sure. For example, Toronto-based Cohere, which competes with ChatGPT, reportedly raised $250 million in May in a deal that values that company at $2 billion. Likewise, also in May, generative AI video platform Runway reportedly raised about $100 million in funding, valuing the company at $1.5 billion.
Likewise, big-name AI startups like Google-backed (GOOG, GOOGL) Anthropic, and AI-focused cloud startup CoreWeave raised rounds, coming in at rounds of $450 million and $421 million respectively.
However, for all the AI hype, these types of investments only accounted for 13% of total VC funding in May.
Nevertheless, there still are a few other pockets of optimism. In May, Crunchbase data shows that there were 10 newly-minted unicorns – a term for private startups valued at $1 billion or more – two of which were Cohere and Runway. Though that number is down from 34 this time last year, May's 10 new unicorns are double the number we saw in April and mark the first time since November that the new unicorn count hit the low double-digits.
However, the overall picture is one that still reads gloomy and shows that across the board, investors remain cautious – that 44% year-over-year decline is tough to shake off and a quiet VC landscape isn't new. VC investments have been down for seed, early, and late-stage startups for some time, and so far, that remains the case. The reality is this: AI is hot, but the economy isn't and, for all the excitement surrounding AI, it remains a minor part of the overall economic picture.

Marko Kolanovic noted it's unusual that tech stocks are surging when interest rates are rising.
""It's hard to say that it cannot go more, but we think it's in a little bit of a bubble domain already,"" he said.
Technology stocks have rallied so strongly this year that they're entering bubble territory, putting them at risk of a pullback once the hype and speculation in markets fades, JPMorgan's top strategist says.
Marko Kolanovic said Wednesday in a CNBC interview that the recent surge in tech shares is ""too exceptional."" He argued the breadth of the 2023 rally has been too narrow, with Big Tech companies powering the benchmark indices' gains this year.
""It's hard to say that it cannot go more, but we think it's in a little bit of a bubble domain already,"" Kolanovic said, adding stocks could see a pullback.
The rebound in tech stocks so far this year partly reflects hype around artificial intelligence following the blockbuster debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Investors have bid up the stock prices of Nvidia, Microsoft, and other tech companies, as they wager they'll be major winners from the AI revolution.
Kolanovic, however, said he's not so bullish given the rise in tech stocks has come at a time when the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates at the fastest pace in history. That disconnect is atypical and a warning sign, he said.
""Technology went up in parallel with interest rates. So interest rates move higher and tech moves higher which typically doesn't happen. That also is a little bit of a worrisome signal,"" Kolanovic said.
""AI is not a new thing,"" the bank's chief global markets strategist said, adding that there's no certainty how the technology is going to play out.
Kolanovic said his team aren't so positive on tech stocks as they're concerned about interest-rate shocks. Higher rates tend to lower valuation multiples on growth stocks, as investors are willing to pay less of a premium for them when they can earn solid returns from bonds and savings accounts. They also worry greater borrowing costs and an economic downturn or recession will slow the companies' progress.
The Fed has raised its benchmark rate from nearly zero to upwards of 5% since early 2022 in a bid to cool historically high US inflation. Investors are gearing up for the central bank's June policy meeting, and waiting to see whether the Fed will pause its tightening after the recent banking-system stress.","Surging tech stocks are entering bubble territory and could see a pullback soon, JPMorgan's top strategist says",374.75,385.10001,387.70001,6,2023,8

The current bull market in stocks is unusual, as they typically begin when valuations for firms are low, he said.
""The problem with melt-ups is that they almost always invariably are followed by meltdowns.""
The stock market could have a meltdown as the bubble in overvalued mega-cap shares begins to burst, according to market veteran Ed Yardeni.
In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, the president of Yardeni Research warned of a potential fallout in stocks, referring to his previous forecast that the craze for artificial intelligence stocks was setting up the market for the ""Mother of All Melt-Ups.""
That's already visible in the outperformance of eight mega-cap stocks this year, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, and other tech titans soaring as they ride the wave of excitement for AI.
Yardeni predicted stocks will continue to rise through 2023 into next year, potentially taking the S&P 500 to 4,600 by year-end. But if stocks rise too quickly, it could spell trouble for the market as the bubble in overvalued names pops.
""The problem with melt-ups is that they almost always invariably are followed by meltdowns,"" Yardeni warned.
He noted that the current bull market in stocks was unusual, as they typically begin when valuations for firms are low. When stocks hit a low of 3,600 in October of last year, stocks were still fairly expensive, Yardeni noted, with the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 hovering around 15.
That ratio is now around 18, largely due to the success of the eight mega-cap firms.
Yardeni's warning comes as other Wall Street strategists have sounded alarms of a coming earnings recession that will hit the market, as firms continue to battle high inflation and high interest rates. High rates also risk tipping the economy into recession, experts warn, which is also likely to weigh on stocks.
For his part, Yardeni previously predicted that the US had a 60% chance of avoiding a recession, as the economy has held up against aggressive interest rates hikes so far.
He is also more upbeat on earnings, saying S&P 500 companies are likely to see profits of $225 a share at the end of the year, above Wall Street's average prediction of $206.","The 'mother of all melt-ups' in stocks could be quickly followed by a meltdown as the bubble in overvalued names pops, Ed Yardeni says",374.75,385.10001,387.70001,6,2023,8

The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.
Speaking of AI stocks, it’s hard to ignore what Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 165% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation at one point.
Ark Invest’s flagship fund Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA: ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia “will do well over time.” But she sees a new group of stocks that will “benefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid.”
The keyword is software.
“In our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS [software as a service] providers will generate $8 in revenue,” she said. “So we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it.”
The super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here’s a look at the trio and another company she calls “the biggest artificial intelligence play.”

UiPath Inc. (NYSE: PATH)
UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.
In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.
The stock has surged 47% year to date, but it hasn’t always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.
Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,865,375 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $517.28 million, UiPath is the fourth-largest holding at Ark.
Twilio Inc. (NYSE: TWLO)
Twilio’s cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.
In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.
In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence “will be a material accelerant over time for Twilio’s business.”
Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,680,705 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $303.54 million.
Teladoc Health Inc. (NYSE: TDOC)
Wood’s flagship fund also owns $301.07 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.
The company’s platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.
At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.
In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.
While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc’s first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.
The stock, however, wasn’t able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $24.30 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.
‘The Biggest Artificial Intelligence Play’
Wood’s biggest bet in the AI arena is a company that isn’t known for being an AI stock — Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA).
“We talk about Tesla all the time, it actually is the biggest artificial intelligence play,” she said.
The reason has to do with the electric car company’s autonomous driving technology.
Tesla is Ark’s largest holding with an 11.81% weighting.
Wood expects autonomous taxi platforms to deliver $8 trillion to $10 trillion in revenue globally in 2030 “from almost zero right now.”
And because of Tesla’s capabilities on that front, the booming autonomous taxi market could take its share price to a whole new level.
“We believe that in five years, 2027, it will be a $2,000 stock if our research is correct,” she said.
Considering that Tesla shares trade at around $235 right now, Wood’s price target implies a potential upside of over 750%.
Investing in disruptive innovation can be very lucrative — but sometimes it can feel like a roller coaster. For instance, while Tesla shares have more than doubled year to date, they are still down over 40% from their peak in November 2021.
If you don’t like that kind of uncertainty, you might want to look into slow-changing industries that provide considerable cash returns to investors — such as those catering to basic human needs like food and shelter. For those seeking to generate passive income without the volatility associated with publicly traded stocks, there are avenues to invest in these essential service businesses through the private market.

According to James Penny, the chief investment officer of TAM Asset Management and a veteran ESG investor, the current mood is reminiscent of the early days of the tech bubble that burst in 2000 and wiped more than 70% off the Nasdaq.
“Companies that even mention the word AI in their earnings are seeing boosts to their share price, and that smells very much like the dot-com era,” Penny, who invests in funds rather than directly in stocks, said in an interview. “I think the market has got a little bit over its skis. I’d put much larger odds on it coming down from here.”
The race to get a piece of the AI boom went into turbo mode last month, after Nvidia Corp. wowed the market with a set of sales targets that surprised even the most upbeat analyst forecasts. The company has added almost 30% to its market value since the announcement in late May, bringing gains this year to more than 160% and helping the Nasdaq add a third to its value.
Nvidia’s Upbeat Forecast Buoys Tech
It’s a development that’s helped boost funds with environmental, social and governance mandates, as ESG portfolios rely increasingly on tech to lower their carbon footprint without sacrificing growth. An analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence shows that tech makes up a third of preferred stocks in so-called Article 9 funds, the highest ESG classification in the European Union. That’s by far the biggest chunk of all sectors.
About 1,300 ESG-registered funds hold more than $20 billion in Nvidia alone, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, there’s a subset of ESG fund managers that market themselves as AI-themed, with Bloomberg identifying 20 as of early June that together hold about $8 billion in assets under management.
While Nvidia supplies the chips for AI processing, the technology itself is being developed by a number of tech giants including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. The market for generative AI products, which refers to tools like ChatGPT that can create content such as text or images from a prompt, has the potential to grow more than 40% a year and reach $1.3 trillion in the coming decade, according to BI senior analyst Mandeep Singh.
Penny, who’s got roughly a decade of experience selecting assets based on their ability to outperform in a world increasingly shaped by environmental and social risks, says eagerness to be exposed to AI is in part feeding off premature bets that the Federal Reserve will start reversing its cycle of interest-rate increases.
With the US grappling with a regional banking crisis, “the market very quickly accelerated into this scenario where rate cuts are going to be coming quite soon because this is obviously evidence of the economy cracking,” Penny said. That “spurred more and more inflow into growth investing.”
Against that backdrop, “you had this AI trend, which just literally came out of nowhere,” and now “the market’s gone off to the races, like massively in,” he said.
But the buying spree has been fed by “just a few sectors,” in fact, just a handful of stocks, Penny said. At the same time, there’s still the very real risk of a recession, he said.
Gold-Rush Playbook
So instead of piling into the same AI names that others are buying up, Penny says he’s following the playbook of the gold rush of the 1800s, when the smart money didn’t waste time looking for gold, but invested in the tools needed to dig it up.
“I think you’re going to see a massive wave of AI-led products in the market and we will be looking at that, but you have to be very selective,” Penny said. “I would be focusing less on AI manufacturers and more on AI adopters, so that ‘pick-and-shovel”’ kind of strategy. That’s “always where you find phenomenal companies that are in support of the theme and the movement,” he said.
Memory chips, which are crucial to the kinds of deep-learning applications needed to support generative AI, are one such area, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence that singled out Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc.
BI also pointed to semiconductor testing devices from US-based Teradyne Inc. and Advantest Corp. of Japan as stocks that are likely to benefit from the furore surrounding AI.
And given the current environment, the goal isn’t to be overly exposed to sectors that rely heavily on low interest rates and a strong economy, Penny said.
“What generates a recession rips apart the status quo,” he said. “So one has to be wary of that high growth narrative.”

NVDA,2023-06-12 20:35:00,"Druckenmiller note, AI companies could have very strong earnings even in the face of an economic downturn","Famed investor, Stanley Druckenmiller hasn’t been shy about how bearish he is on the market, stating that he still believes there will be a hard landing sometime in the next year. However, he notes that “AI could be as transformative as the internet,” and that AI companies could have very strong earnings even in the face of an economic downturn.
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Druckenmiller said that “we had a hard landing in 1974, 1975, but chemicals and oils did great.” So, while Druck is nervous about the health of this market, he is increasingly bullish on the AI sector nonetheless, saying that AI stocks have dominated his long portfolio over the last five months.
In the first quarter Druckenmiller bought new positions in Microsoft MSFT and IQVIA Holdings IQV, which are now in the top ten holdings of his equity portfolio. Microsoft is the majority investor in OpenAI, which has exploded onto the scene with its ChatGPT app, and IQVIA is a healthcare technology company utilizing AI for research and commercial purposes.
Additionally, he has owned Nvidia NVDA, the big AI winner, since Q4 2022. It is currently the second largest position in his portfolio at 9.5%, all according to a 13F filing. It is worth noting that the 13F represents ~$2 billion of Druckemiller’s assets, which is just an estimated 20% of his net worth and excludes short positions and derivatives.

Nvidia
Druck said that he could see himself owning Nvidia for several years, although he is well known for changing his mind on a dime. Nvidia currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions.
EPS and sales estimates have absolutely exploded higher over the last two months. Now that investors understand the magnitude of AI, and the computing power necessary, NVDA’s future business potential has shattered prior expectations.
Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 96% and are expected to grow 300% YoY. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by 70% and are expected to climb 129% YoY.
Sales estimates have grown considerably as well, with next quarter sales projected to grow 100% YoY, FY23 sales to grow 60%, and FY24 sales to increase by 30%.

The Nvidia price chart also offers a compelling technical trade setup. Although NVDA stock has rallied a whopping 180% YTD, momentum stocks like this often go further than expected. Additionally, this trade setup provides explicit points where it is no longer attractive to traders.
If NVDA can trade above the $395 level, it could push the stock to another new high. However, if the price can’t hold above $375, investors may want to be patient and wait for another opportunity to buy lower.

IQVIA
IQVIA is a leading global provider of advanced analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the healthcare industry. The company leverages its deep expertise and comprehensive data to help clients make informed decisions.
Through AI algorithms and machine learning capabilities, IQVIA analyzes and interprets complex datasets, helping healthcare organizations optimize clinical trials, enhance patient safety, and make more informed decisions. By leveraging AI, IQVIA empowers healthcare professionals to identify patterns, predict trends, and uncover innovative solutions that drive efficiency, accuracy, and ultimately, better patient care.
IQV currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating mixed earnings revisions. While the company has experienced steady growth in sales and earnings over the past decade, analysts are cautious in the near term.
Analysts have unanimously downgraded current quarter earnings by -5% over the last two months and EPS is expected to drop -3% YoY. The company still expects steady sales growth over the next two years though. FY23 sales are projected to grow 6% YoY and FY24 sales are expected to climb 9.2% YoY.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
IQV is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20x, and in line with its 10-year median. Because of the mixed earnings revisions, and average valuation, investors may want to wait for the valuation to drop below its long-term median, or for analysts to raise estimates before considering buying.

Microsoft
Microsoft is another technology giant that is very well positioned for the AI revolution. With its OpenAI investment, and litany of software and hardware products which will be further enhanced by the integration of AI technology, MSFT is a logical investment for those looking to get exposure to the burgeoning sector.
MSFT has experienced some mixed earnings revisions over the last two months contributing to its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analysts are beginning to upgrade their views, with the majority posting mildly bullish expectations.

Microsoft does have a stretched valuation at the moment though. It is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34x, which is above the market average of 20x, and well above its 10-year median of 25x. With a historically rich valuation and mixed earnings estimates, investors may want to wait for one of these to improve, although Druckenmiller certainly sees something he likes.

NVDA,2023-06-13 12:34:03,An investment boom in artificial intelligence technologies has been spurred by the rise of OpenAI's bot ChatGPT.,"Investors are loving AI right now, with chipmaker Nvidia sitting near a $1 trillion market cap.
But a veteran investor told Bloomberg it ""smells very much like the dot-com era.""
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has cautioned against the recent hype.
The AI boom could end up the same way as the dot-com bubble, a veteran ESG investor warned in a recent Bloomberg interview.
""Companies that even mention the word AI in their earnings are seeing boosts to their share price, and that smells very much like the dot-com era,"" James Penny, the chief investment officer of TAM Asset Management, told Bloomberg.
The dot-com boom in the late '90s happened as investors poured money into companies that prioritized the internet.
Some businesses did very well, like Amazon. Others went bust.
In one week in May, enthusiasm for AI saw a record $8.5 billion invested into tech funds. And new research indicated that the generative AI market could become a $1.3 trillion industry by 2032.
Last month, chipmaker Nvidia reached a $1 trillion market cap thanks to the AI hype, because its graphics processing units are used to process machine learning algorithms.
Its share price had gone up over 170% this year, and analysts are expecting it to continue to soar as it leads the AI arms race.
Basically, there's a lot of money to be made in the AI sector right now. But Penny's suggesting that could all come tumbling down if people aren't careful about overhyping products.
Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO – the company behind ChatGPT – has also cautioned against the recent hype, saying there's ""too much of an investor frenzy around AI in the short-term.""
""I think the market has got a little bit over its skis,"" Penny told Bloomberg. ""I'd put much larger odds on it coming down from here.""

Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987 as the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model in which TSMC acted purely as a contract manufacturer. This business model proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a single-minded focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became its key customers. While many other foundry competitors emerged over the years, TSMC has outcompeted them with superior execution, operating efficiency, high-quality customer service, and the benefits of economies of scale. Today, TSMC controls approximately 60% of the total semiconductor foundry market and has a near-monopoly in manufacturing the world's most advanced chips. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing, while customer relationships are becoming increasingly sticky.
We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, with continued market share gains driven by its superior technology, reliability, and customer service. We expect TSMC to continue to benefit from the virtuous cycle of its scale advantage - higher profits leading to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We expect TSMC will remain a key enabler of future technological innovation, including AI and High Performance Computing, and a major beneficiary of the increasing pervasiveness of chips, including in electric vehicles and IoT.""",Here’s Why You Should Consider Buying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

The company’s Instinct MI300 series will include an accelerator that can speed processing for generative AI — the technology used by ChatGPT and other chatbots — AMD said during a presentation in San Francisco on Tuesday. The product, called MI300X, is part of a lineup that was unveiled at the CES conference in January.
Like much of the chip industry, AMD is racing to meet booming demand for AI computing. Popular services that rely on large language models — algorithms that crunch massive amounts of data in order to answer queries and generate images — are pushing data centers to the limit. And so far, Nvidia has had an edge in supplying the technology needed to handle these workloads.
“We are still very, very early in the life cycle of AI,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said at the event.
The total addressable market for data center AI accelerators will rise fivefold to more than $150 billion in 2027, she said. “It’s going to be a lot.”
Still, the presentation failed to dazzle investors, who already have sky-high expectations for AI growth. They had bid up AMD shares 99% this year through Monday’s close, but the stock drifted down more than 3% during Tuesday’s event.
Executives from Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Meta Platforms Inc. joined Su on stage to talk about using new AMD processors in their data centers. The chipmaker also announced the general availability of the latest version of its Epyc server processors and a new variant called Bergamo that is aimed at cloud computing uses.
The MI300X accelerator is based on AMD’s CDNA 3 technology and uses as much as 192 gigabytes of memory to handle workloads for large language models and generative AI, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.
Key customers will start sampling the technology in the third quarter, with full production starting in the fourth, AMD said. Another model, the Instinct MI300A, is going out to customers now.

NVDA,2023-06-13 19:43:30,"Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub, and investor Daniel Gross have bought thousands of Nvidia GPUs and are making them available to startups.","Nvidia GPUs are essential for training the big models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.
These special chips are very expensive and in short supply.
That gives big tech companies an advantage over smaller startups. Some rich VCs are trying to help.
Nvidia GPUs are the water that feeds today's flourishing AI ecosystem. Without the power that the A100 and H100 chips provide, ChatGPT and most other new generative AI services wouldn't exist.
With the boom in AI startups and services, there's so much demand for these crucial components that Nvidia, and manufacturing partner TSMC, can't make enough of them. While the demand has been great for Nvidia, which gained almost $200 billion in market cap in a single day last month after announcing higher revenue guidance for its GPU chips, it's been less fortunate for AI startups. Prices have soared and shortages are common.
This is giving Big Tech companies another huge advantage over smaller upstarts. If you really want to compete in this new AI world, you have to train your own models with your own data, which can require a large amount of GPUs. Otherwise, you will just be another app on someone else's platform.
Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, knows this, Google does too. Even Adobe does. They are rushing to train large foundation models on huge amounts of data and have the benefit of billions of dollars to invest in this expensive process.
Many startups can't afford that, or they just can't get hold of the chips. Even tech juggernaut Microsoft is facing a hardware crunch, going as far as to ration internal access to GPUs to save processing power for its AI-powered Bing chatbot and AI Microsoft Office tools, The Information reported.
So, some venture capitalists are taking unusual steps to help.
Nat Friedman, the former CEO of GitHub, and Daniel Gross, who has backed GitHub, Uber, and a host of other successful startups, have purchased thousands of GPUs and set up their own AI cloud service.
Called Andromeda Cluster, the system has 2,512 H100 GPUs and is capable of training a 65 billion parameter AI model in about 10 days, the VCs said. That's not the largest model out there, but it's a sizeable one.
The catch: This is only available for startups backed by Friedman and Gross. Still, the move is being praised already.

NVDA,2023-06-13 21:10:13,AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su tells Yahoo Finance her company is ready to roll into the AI movement.,"AMD (AMD) is poised to take the fight to AI superchip rival Nvidia (NVDA).
On Tuesday, AMD unveiled its most advanced chip yet targeted toward red-hot generative AI technology. Dubbed the MI300x, it can use up to 192GB of memory. The beefy memory capabilities mean AMD's new chip could be applied to AI large language models, commonly known as ""LLMs.""
The graphics processing units (GPUs) of AMD's ilk are the kinds that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT AI platform.
And AMD's new chip could be ripe to wrestle market share away from Nvidia's buzzy AI chip called the H100, which supports 120GB of memory.
AMD chairman and CEO Dr. Lisa Su told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) the technology is transformative, and the unveiling was a ""special day"" in her career and for the company.
""There’s an incredible amount of technology on here — we’re talking about the most complex chip we’ve ever built,"" Su explained. ""The whole purpose is to make AI much much more accessible. So everybody who wants to use AI needs more GPUs, and we have a GPU that is incredibly powerful; very, very efficient; and we believe will be a significant winner in the AI market.""
Su believes AMD will be able to make enough chips in 2024 to support demand. She declined to share the pricing on the new AI chips.
AMD stock fell 3% on Tuesday following the product release news despite the clear promise of the technology.
But shares have shot up 82% year to date in hopes that AMD can rival Nvidia in AI chips while also continuing to win market share in data centers from struggling competitor Intel (INTC).
""AMD appears to have a large design win for its MI300 chip, however, we question the sustainability of a combined graphics/CPU IC given performance limitations and an unsuccessful history,"" Citi chip analyst Chris Danely pointed out in a new client note. ""While we expect AMD to keep gaining share versus Intel, the ramp of its new Genoa product appears to be slower than expected.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services, the world's largest cloud computing provider, is considering using new artificial intelligence chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc, though it has not made a final decision, an AWS executive told Reuters.
The remarks came during an AMD event where the chip company outlined its strategy for the AI market, which is dominated by rival Nvidia Corp.
Despite AMD disclosing some technical specifications for an AI chip coming later this year that could in some ways beat Nvidia's best current offerings on some metrics, the news sent shares down after AMD did not disclose a flagship customer for the chip.
In interviews with Reuters, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su outlined an approach to winning over major cloud computing customers by offering a menu of all the pieces needed to build the kinds of systems to power services similar to ChatGPT, but letting customers pick and choose which they want, using industry standard connections.
""We're betting that a lot of people are going to want choice, and they're going to want the ability to customize what they need in their data center,"" Su said.
While AWS has not made any public commitments to use AMD's new MI300 chips in its cloud services, Dave Brown, vice president of elastic compute cloud at Amazon, said AWS is considering them.
""We're still working together on where exactly that will land between AWS and AMD, but it's something that our teams are working together on,"" Brown said. ""That's where we've benefited from some of the work that they've done around the design that plugs into existing systems.""
Nvidia does sell its chips piecemeal but is also asking cloud providers if they are willing to offer an entire system designed by Nvidia in a product called DGX Cloud. Oracle Corp is Nvidia's first partner for that system.
Brown said AWS had declined to work with Nvidia on the DGX Cloud offering.
""They approached us, we looked at the business model, and it didn't make a lot of sense,"" Brown said.
Brown said that AWS prefers to design its own servers from the ground up. AWS started selling Nvidia's H100 chip in March, but as part of systems of its own design.

However, those gains are a bit deceiving as the bulk of the upside has been driven by only a few selected stocks, namely the tech Mega Caps (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMZN). If we exclude those five stocks, the index has only advanced by 5%.
While one could argue that the market is due for a cooling down period after such a rally, Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Kostin suggests otherwise, citing past evidence. “Prior episodes of sharply narrowing breadth have been followed by a ‘catch-up’ from a broader valuation re-rating,” Kostin explained.
As such, Kostin not only increased Goldman’s year-end price target for the S&P 500 from 4000 to 4500 (a 12.5% lift), but there’s also the prospect of stocks yet to reap the benefits of the rally closing the gap as the year progresses.
Against this backdrop, Goldman Sachs analysts have been seeking out those equities and have turned their focus to two that have plenty of upside, according to their calculations – in the order of 90%, or more. Running the tickers through the TipRanks database, it’s clear Goldman is not alone in thinking these stocks have plenty to offer investors; both are also rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus.
Rent the Runway (RENT)
Our first Goldman-backed stock is a disruptor in the fashion industry. Rent the Runway lives up to its moniker by accurately describing its activities, which involve offering clients the opportunity to rent high-end fashion items. This concept of temporary ownership allows customers to browse a diverse range of styles, sizes, and brands on the Rent the Runway website or mobile app. They can then choose items to rent for specific occasions or timeframes. The platform provides options for both one-time rentals and subscription plans. In line with the trends of 2023, the company utilizes AI algorithms and machine learning techniques to enhance various aspects of its business, including inventory management and personalization.
It’s a formula that helped the company deliver a strong set of results in its most recent readout – for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 (April quarter). Revenue rose by 10.6% year-over-year to $74.2 million, beating the Street’s expectations by $0.99 million. Likewise, EPS of -$0.46 came in better than the -$0.49 the prognosticators were looking for. That said, concerns about the outlook blotted the performance. The company sees FQ2 revenue hitting the range between $77 million to $79 million. Consensus was looking for 81 million.
Shares pulled back consequently and have generally lagged the market this year – declining by 24% so far. For Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, however, the present valuation represents an opportunity for investors.
“In our view, RENT shares (at current levels) are not pricing-in the multi-year scenario of 25% topline growth and scaling margins that mgmt. outlined last quarter,” said the 5-star analyst. “Longer term, we still see RENT as the leader in the subscription-based effort to drive the adoption of the sharing economy theme in the apparel sector. In particular, we would flag RENT mgmt’s comments on AI as a potential positive for their platform and a broader disruptive force for the industry which warrants further attention in coming quarters.”
These comments underpin Sheridan’s Buy rating on RENT, while his $6 price target suggests the stock will run up by a bountiful 150% over the coming year. (To watch Sheridan’s track record, click here)
Sheridan’s upbeat thesis gets support on the Street. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 6 Buys vs. 1 Hold. Additionally, the $4.93 average target leaves room for one-year gains of 105%. (See RENT stock forecast)
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR)
For our next Goldman-backed name we’ll switch gears and head to the biotech space. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is at the forefront of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, developing innovative medicines that target and silence specific disease-causing genes. The company’s cutting-edge technology, known as the Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM) platform, enables the precise delivery of RNAi drugs to specific tissues and organs, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of various diseases.
The company has a lengthy and diverse clinical pipeline and some eye-catching industry collaborations including Takeda, Amgen, and Horizon Therapeutics. Looking forward, Arrowhead expects to have 18 drug candidates in clinical studies by the end of 2023, ​addressing a broad range of cell types, such as liver, solid tumor, pulmonary, CNS, and skeletal muscle. It also already has candidates in Phase 3 studies.
Further back in development, but making some promising progress, the company is also developing ARO-RAGE, currently in a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of patients with asthma. This drug has been showing some positive results. At Arrowhead’s recent R&D Day, the firm presented data that showed that a single inhaled dose of 184 mg knocked down the RAGE protein – which is correlated with lung diseases such as asthma – by an average of 90% and up to a maximum of 95%.
This drug’s potential has caught the eye of Goldman Sachs analyst Madhu Kumar, who lays down the bullish thesis for the therapy.
“There is significant market potential for ARO-RAGE in the broader asthma therapeutic landscape,” said the 5-star analyst. “Specifically, we estimate the biologics market for eosinophilic asthma to reach over $4B in 2023 and grow to about $7B over the next five years. This estimate takes into account sales estimates for Tezspire from AMGN and JNJ, Nucala from GSK, Fasenra from AZN, and Dupixent from REGN and SNY.”
“While many of these biologics share the same dosing regimen as ARO-RAGE of once every four weeks (although ARO-RAGE could potentially be dosed less frequently), we see potential for differentiation with respect to efficacy, including rate of exacerbation, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO),” Kumar went on to add.

NVDA,2023-06-14 22:58:01,The NYU finance professor known as the 'Dean of Valuation' thinks Nvidia would have to dominate the whole AI market to justify its current price.,"The narrative behind Nvidia's stock rally makes sense but its current share price doesn't, according to Aswath Damodaran.
The 'Dean of Valuation' thinks Nvidia would have to dominate the whole AI market to justify its current price.
There's too little upside left to the chipmaker's stock, the NYU finance professor told CNBC.
Nvidia's spectacular 185% rally has been the highlight of the US stock market this year. The chipmaker outperformed every other S&P 500 stock as investors boosted bets it will benefit substantially from the artificial-intelligence boom.
That story makes sense, but the stock's current price of around $415 doesn't, according to NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, who earned the nickname 'Dean of Valuation' for his focus on estimating the value of assets.
Nvidia would have to ""decimate or dominate the entire AI market for it to be justifying this price,"" Damodaran told CNBC on Tuesday. It's a bet he's just not willing to take and there's too little upside left to the stock, according to him.
Damodaran cashed in his Nvidia stake after the chip maker's scorching rally – when it touched a $1 trillion valuation for the first time at the end of May and joined a handful of companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Amazon that have reached the mark.
He told news outlets at the time that as someone who specializes in spotting stocks that trade below their intrinsic value, he couldn't justify holding on to Nvidia shares.
""AI has been this buzzword that pushes every company forward. The two companies that have really something material to show for it are Microsoft and Nvidia and both have benefited — Nvidia in particular,"" Damodaran told CNBC.
""The story makes sense, the pricing doesn't,"" he added.
Still, Damodaran thinks AI will make changes that have the potential to dramatically shift the way people live and work – ""and those changes always have valuation consequences.""
""AI is changing the conversation and I think it has the potential unlike with the Cloud or Metaverse, where I felt I could not quite see the magnitude of the business that came out of both worlds,"" he told CNBC.",'Dean of Valuation' Aswath Damodaran says the story behind Nvidia's stock surge makes sense but its current price doesn't,410.22,429.97,426.53,6,2023,14
NVDA,2023-06-15 02:12:12,"""The past year's monetary tightening have yet to be felt and ultimately a recession will likely be necessary to return inflation to target.""","Investors should be wary of stocks as a recession is still likely, JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic said.
In a Wednesday note, he remained underweight equities and overweight cash.
""The past year's monetary tightening have yet to be felt and ultimately a recession will likely be necessary to return inflation to target.""
While investors are seized by a new bull market in stocks, top JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic is still cautious.
In a note on Wednesday, he remained underweight equities and overweight cash, even as risk assets have performed well since lawmakers reached a deal earlier this month to suspend the US debt ceiling, averting a catastrophic default.
""While the economy's recent resilience may delay the onset of a recession, we believe that most of the lagged effects of the past year's monetary tightening have yet to be felt and ultimately a recession will likely be necessary to return inflation to target,"" Kolanovic wrote.
""As such, we maintain a defensive asset allocation and believe the risk-reward for equities remains poor given the disconnect between equities and bonds, high likelihood of a recession over the coming quarters, high rates, tightening liquidity, rich valuations, and the still-narrow market breadth.""
His warning about market breadth comes as just a handful of mega-cap tech stocks, like Microsoft and Nvidia, have driven market indexes higher this year.
Others on Wall Street have pointed to recent gains among small-cap equities as a sign that the narrowness has eased, demonstrating that investors were once again willing to bet on riskier stocks.
But Kolanovic largely stuck to his stance from May, when he counseled investors to replace equity investments with gold and cash, given the then-unresolved debt ceiling crisis.
On Wednesday, he said more central bank hawkishness is possible, pointing to recent tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada.
""A long duration stance is starting to look more attractive, as US rates markets have priced out most of the previously-expected cuts; however, we maintain our light duration positioning given the risk that central banks are compelled to restart their rate hiking cycles on inflation persistence, e.g. illustrated by surprise hikes by the RBA and BoC last week,"" he wrote.","Investors should avoid stocks even amid this year's bullishness because a recession is still on the way, JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic says",429.97,426.53,426.92001,6,2023,15

NVDA,2023-06-15 17:29:05,The company's new MI300X AI Chip will be a direct competitor to the dominance of Nvidia's H100.,"AMD unveiled its new MI300X AI Accelerator chip, a direct challenge to NVIDIA's reigning H100, in a move to leverage its success in the industry frenzy over AI. The tech giant's latest addition to its AI chip arsenal aims to disrupt NVIDIA's dominance in the AI accelerator market.
Tailored explicitly for AI tasks, the MI300X is packed with up to 192GB of memory, making it an ideal choice for executing large models like LLMs. AMD's choice of a high memory configuration is a strategic one, enabling easy deployment of expansive models. AI training requires massive computational power, but overall, it needs a lot of vRAM to store information during training sessions —this is why some gaming GPUs may be good to mine crypto but are not really great for AI tasks.
Furthermore, the underlying architecture of the chip has been engineered to support generative AI workloads smoothly. AMD CEO Lisa Su points out that the latest generation of leading-edge models can easily find a home in the MI300X’s 192GB of HBM3 (high-bandwidth memory).
“With all of that additional memory capacity, we actually have an advantage for large language models because we can run larger models directly in memory.” Lisa Su elaborated, explaining that users will need less GPUs to accomplish the same tasks in less time.
This product launch comes at a time when NVIDIA’s market capitalisation has hit the $1 trillion mark. While AMD's market cap doesn't quite compare —it’s just over $207 billion— the release of the MI300X underscores AMD's determination to make its mark in the expanding AI landscape.
To further demonstrate its commitment, AMD successfully ran the Falcon 40B LLM on the MI300X during the chip's reveal. This achievement, as per Su, marks the “first time an LLM of this size can be run entirely in memory”.
AMD: A Powerful Contender to Nvidia’s Domination of the AI Space
In a simultaneous revelation, AMD released an update to RocM, a software stack for graphics processing unit (GPU) programming which is a robust contender against NVIDIA's CUDA language. The significant memory bandwidth available with the MI300X could persuade companies to purchase fewer GPUs, presenting AMD as a compelling value proposition, particularly for smaller firms with light to medium AI workloads.
AMD has greatly profited from the AI hype, with its stocks experiencing a significant surge this year. The company’s rise has not only drawn the attention of investors but also generated positive chatter in the industry.
Can AMD become the next NVIDIA? It's a tough call, given the vast disparity in their market capitalization. However, one thing is certain: AMD's MI300X AI Accelerator is a force to be reckoned with.
In this AI-driven arena, it's not just about the size of the player, but also the strength of their game. As AMD steps up to the plate, the world will be watching to see if this underdog can hit a home run.",AMD Debuts AI Chip to Challenge Nvidia,429.97,426.53,426.92001,6,2023,15
NVDA,2023-06-15 19:26:37,"The valuations of AI companies are likely somewhat overblown right now, Principal Asset Management Chief Global Strategist Seema Shah and Frank Funds CIO Brian Frank told Yahoo Finance Live.","The valuations of AI companies are likely somewhat overblown right now, Principal Asset Management Chief Global Strategist Seema Shah and Frank Funds CIO Brian Frank told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).
""We are significant believers in the broader long-term perspective of technology and, of course, AI is right at the center of that,"" said Shah. ""I do think, though, as we look out over the broader market reaction over the last couple of months, that there's maybe a little bit of froth. There are a lot of expectations from investors, and probably some of those expectations will not be delivered, met within the next few months.""
""I think from that froth, you could see a little bit of a pullback,"" she added, noting that long-term AI will still offer benefits to the companies that get it right.
In the last few months, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and C3 AI (AI) have seen massive gains as AI has become tech's biggest buzzword. But if you're a retail investor, now perhaps isn't the best time to get involved in the AI hype, at least not for the biggest names in the sector, Shah said.
""Anything that can benefit or even ride on the back of some of these AI stocks and the [underlying] technology, we think, stands to do well,"" said Shah. ""I have to say that for investors, at these prices, certainly for the ones like NVIDIA... it's probably not a great time to get involved, but there are other mechanisms within the broader market where you can get exposure to technology to the AI craze.""
'I'm optimistic AI will actually increase employment'
Ultimately, it isn't just tech companies that stand to benefit from AI. Though there are a deluge of fears that AI will take jobs, there's reason to believe that AI will ultimately improve jobs in all sorts of industries rather than slash them, and facilitate a more productive overall economy, said Frank, who's taking an ""optimistic stand"" on how AI will affect employment.
""You hear different industries applying AI to their jobs and it actually makes people more efficient,"" he said. ""It doesn't necessarily put them out of work, it just actually makes them more productive. So, I'm optimistic that AI will actually increase employment and [create] better quality employment, as well. It could be a great thing for everybody.""
AI can also have benefits for the broader economy – if regulators don't halt innovation, Shah said.
""Overall, I think the one thing that we can say is that if technology is permitted to... fulfill the potential it has, there will be a very significant productivity boost to the U.S. economy and globally,"" she told Yahoo Finance Live.
However, Shah expects that regulators are increasingly likely to get involved, citing regulatory scrutiny as a ""significant concern.""
""I think it's been a concern for tech investors for many years, just waiting to see how regulators are going to respond to ever-improving technology,"" she said. ""Now, from our perspective, things don't come in overnight, but you can see that [more regulation] is the direction Congress is going towards. For investors who have these very high hopes of what technology can deliver, there's a concern that regulations will pull back on some of that, and there could be some disappointment that, unfortunately, would pull down not just the technology sector, but the broader market.""

""We still think there's a lot left in the tank here,"" Ryan Detrick told CNBC.
The S&P 500's brilliant start to 2023 is likely to carry on with the benchmark index potentially hitting a new all-time high before the year is over, according to Carson Group's chief market strategist.
The stock-market gauge is up 15% year-to-date, powered higher by triple-digit gains from Big Tech stocks including Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla – and investors shouldn't expect that rally to end anytime soon, Ryan Detrick said Thursday.

US retail sales unexpectedly rose last month, according to data released Thursday – suggesting that consumer spending has remained high despite some economists fretting about a looming recession.
Meanwhile, inflation cooled to just 4% in May, according to Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report – and that encouraged the Fed to ""skip"" an interest-rate hike at its June meeting, with the central bank opting not to raise borrowing costs for the first time in 15 months.
A new record high for the index ""before this year is quite possible with all this news we keep having – the consumer's strong, inflation, the Fed is likely done,"" Detrick told CNBC.

NVDA,2023-06-16 18:00:00,Insider's Phil Rosen breaks down what's powering the stock market back to levels last seen when the Fed first embarked on its rate hike campaign.,"Happy Friday! Phil Rosen here. It's great to be in your inbox this morning.
It's been 15 months since Jerome Powell embarked on one of the most aggressive policy campaigns ever.
After much pain and a brutal bear market, the S&P 500 has erased all of the losses from the past year and then some.
1. It's true: the S&P 500 has erased all of its losses since the Fed's first rate hike in March 2022.
The index dipped initially after the Fed paused Wednesday, but it finished the session higher at 4,372.59.
On March 16, 2022 — the day of the Fed's first rate hike this cycle — the S&P 500 closed at 4,357.86.
Remember, last spring we were staring down historic inflation and the prospect of climbing borrowing costs. That led to a sell-off across asset classes, a bear market, and enough recession calls to last a decade.
But the key stock index has effectively shrugged off all that for two reasons:
Strong earnings.
AI hype.
Simply put, corporate earnings have been able to defy downbeat outlooks more than anyone expected, and the ballooning hype in the AI space has powered a broad stock rally.
Names like Nvidia and Meta have led the way with triple-digit returns in 2023, and smaller tech names have benefited too.
With inflation still cooling at a steady clip and the Fed's latest pause, investors are acting like there are better days ahead, even if Powell points to a couple of more hikes to come.
History says as much, too.
In years past, a pause in rate increases preceded double-digit returns in the market.

Nvidia is one of only a handful of companies boasting a 13-figure valuation. Some of the most prominent ones include Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Some of which have even surpassed $2 trillion in recent months.
Nvidia's rise can be attributed to the increased demand for semiconductors during the COVID-19 pandemic as the labor market adjusted to remote work and the recent artificial intelligence (AI) boom.

The AI Boom
Though experts are split regarding Nvidia's ability to maintain its dominance in the AI chips market, almost everybody unanimously agrees that AI is the next big thing in tech. ChatGPT, the viral generative artificial intelligence tool downloaded nearly half a million times in the first week of launch, has become the fastest-growing consumer application in history. The AI platform reached 100 million active users in just the first two months, a feat that has not been observed in the ""20 years following the internet space,"" according to UBS analysts.
While the Nividia stock's stark overvaluation might make it too expensive for retail investors, investing in AI-powered startups such as Gameflip on popular crowdfunding platforms can be a feasible alternative. While the chances of Nvidia's share prices falling in the near term are high, as the stock has already begun pulling back, startups leveraging AI technology can harness the recent AI boom without having to worry about temporary stock market reversals.
Top-Performing Stock In The S&P 500 Index
Nvidia has been the best-performing stock over the past few years, successfully capitalizing on the increasing demand for microchips and the rising popularity of AI. Up more than 165% year to date and by nearly 130% over the past year, Nvidia stock is one of the biggest winners of the pandemic and recent focus on AI.
Analysts have long been bullish on Nvidia, with CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino stating, ""We view Nvidia as the most important company on the planet in an era that is rapidly changing towards one that will be emphasized by greater AI capabilities.""
Nvidia's AI Power Tool: A100 Chips
Nvidia's flagship graphics processors and AI chips have made it the most valuable company right now. Thanks to the rising demand for AI chips used in data centers and generative AI applications made by OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, Nvidia is poised to have a ""giant record year,"" according to CEO Jensen Huang. The company is beating old industry titans, including Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which reflects the fast-paced environment of the tech industry.
Nvidia controls 95% of the market share for graphics processors used for AI and machine learning, with its crown jewel A100 chip priced at approximately $10,000, according to a New Street Research report.
Huang credits OpenAI's ChatGPT for its recent success and fleeting trillion-dollar valuation.
""The flashpoint was generative AI,"" he said, ""We know that CPU [central processing unit] scaling has slowed, we know that accelerated computing is the path forward and then the killer app showed up.""
Overvaluation Concerns And Elon Musk's Warning
It is no surprise that the world's most valuable publicly traded semiconductor manufacturer's shares are overvalued. Nividia stock, which nearly tripled over the past eight months, is currently trading 49.87 times its forward non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings. The industry average forward price-to-earnings ratio is 22.33, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., one of the top semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is trading just above 20 times its forward earnings.
Billionaire polymath Elon Musk, known for his controversial stance on several socioeconomic topics and temperamental tweets, responded to a tweet stating that Nividia stock has delivered the highest returns compared to any other U.S. stock over the past 10 years.
Musk stated that Nvidia's monopoly in the AI chips market is going to end soon, with other semiconductor manufacturers ramping up their innovation and production capabilities.
""Also, many other NN [neural network] accelerator chips are also under development. Nvidia will not have a monopoly on large-scale training & inference forever,"" the Tesla CEO tweeted on June 7. Nividia stock hit a month-to-date low on June 7 following Musk's tweet.

Microsoft's stock price hit an all-time high on Thursday, boosting its market value to an unprecedented $2.59 trillion, buoyed by a wave of investor ebullience over artificial intelligence.
The tech giant's stock rose 3.2% to $348.1 on Thursday. They extended gains in Friday's pre-market trading to reach $350.25.
Microsoft is widely seen as one of the leaders of the ongoing AI revolution - given that it's an investor in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, has embedded the tools into its Bing web browser and is looking to extend that to its complete lineup of applications.
JPMorgan analysts lifted their target on Microsoft's share price earlier on Thursday, from $315 to $350, and made note of the company's forward-looking investments in AI.
""We reaffirm our bullish-outlier viewpoint on generative AI and continue to see it driving a resurgence of confidence in key software franchises,"" the analysts wrote in a note, per Reuters.
Microsoft's stock has extended its year-to-date rally to over 45%. Tech stocks have outperformed this year after a dismal 2022, benefiting from the hype over AI as well as investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon end its aggressive interest-rate increases.
Other mega-cap tech companies — like chipmaker Nvidia in particular, which briefly touched the $1 trillion valuation mark — have led the market's rally since the beginning of 2023, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advancing 31% so far this year.",Microsoft's market value hits an all-time high of $2.6 trillion as the AI-fueled stock surge continues,426.53,426.92001,438.07999,6,2023,16
NVDA,2023-06-20 20:10:24,"""Investors may be in for a rude awakening,"" Mike Wilson, who's one of Wall Street's biggest bears, wrote in a note to clients Monday.","One of Wall Street's most bearish strategists isn't expecting the stock-market rally to last.
Slumping growth could soon crush equities, according to Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson.
“Investors may be in for a rude awakening,” he wrote in a note to clients Monday.
Slumping economic growth could be about to stop the stock-market rally in its tracks, Morgan Stanley's top strategist has warned.
Mike Wilson said Monday that he's sticking with his view that the economy will stagnate in the second half of the year, which he expects will chip away at listed companies' earnings and drag down stock prices.
""Given our fundamental view on growth, we find it hard to get on board with the current excitement and narrative supporting it,"" Wilson, who is Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients.
""Investors may be in for a rude awakening given the very big reach for risk we are seeing,"" he added. ""Time will tell but suffice it to say, we haven't changed our view on the growth front.""
Wilson has been one of Wall Street's most bearish voices in 2023, repeatedly predicting a stock-market slump – but his pessimistic outlook hasn't been realized yet.
Equities have instead started the year on a tear, with the S&P 500 jumping 15% and the Nasdaq Composite soaring 31% year-to-date.
But the gains have come amid signs that the US economy is slowing dramatically, with the country's Gross Domestic Product rising just 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023.
Big Tech powerhouses like Nvidia and Microsoft have helped the benchmark indices to shake off that gloomy outlook, with investors enthused by the explosion of interest in ChatGPT piling into artificial intelligence-related stocks.
But even AI – which Morgan Stanley previously labeled a $6 trillion investing opportunity – won't prevent the early-2023 bull market from dying out, according to Wilson.
""To be clear, we believe in the AI theme, too; and believe it will be a big component in the next boom,"" he wrote. ""We just don't think it will prevent the deceleration that is already in motion for this year.""","Slumping growth could soon kill the stock-market rally, Morgan Stanley's top strategist says",426.92001,438.07999,430.45001,6,2023,20

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the top 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.
The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.
This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.
AI and the US Stock Market
In May, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.
This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. According to CNBC, the S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.
""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""
This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.
Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, we have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. We included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but we also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.

NVDA,2023-06-21 16:57:26,"Finding the next AI moment could be investors' best chance of beating the market, Christian Nolting said Tuesday.","Finding the next AI moment could be investors' best hope of generating positive returns, according to Deutsche Bank's CIO.
""This is what the future of markets will be,"" Christian Nolting told Bloomberg.
Other stocks will suffer as inflation remains sticky and the Federal Reserve cuts rates at a later point than markets expect, he added.
Finding the next high-growth investing theme will likely be investors' only real hope for generating positive returns, according to Deutsche Bank's CIO.
Christian Nolting said late Tuesday that he's expecting artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies to become even more dominant, with other stocks struggling due to sticky inflation and the Federal Reserve holding interest rates at a high level.
""Very importantly, I think this is what the future of markets will be,"" he told Bloomberg Radio. ""Growth themes will be maybe overdone at one point in time, but you always will need to find them – because unfortunately, our macro outlook for growth in the next years is not the best one.""
The rise of AI has been one of the biggest stories in markets in 2023, with stocks like Nvidia racking up triple-digit gains thanks to an explosion of interest in the investing theme.
The sector's outperformance ""is not a surprise,"" Nolting said.
""[AI] was there before in cars and machines, but I think it really got tangible at the beginning of the year,"" he added. ""Normally that happens then a lot of people look into that, work with that, and find out – whoa, this is something that can really improve productivity growth.""
Stocks' breakneck rally – with the S&P 500 climbing 14% and the Nasdaq Composite soaring 31% year-to-date – has come despite lingering concerns about soaring prices and the impact of the Fed's rate hikes.
Nolting believes that equities are set for a much more muted second half of the year because of those factors.
Core inflation will ""remain sticky and not go back to the always-mentioned 2% level very quickly because of higher wages,"" he told Bloomberg.
""The worst thing that could happen to the central bank is that they cut rates, in order to find out core inflation's sticky, and then they hike again,"" Notling added. ""I think that's something we want to avoid.""

NVDA,2023-06-21 18:43:38,"In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to equal weight from overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near term questions about the stock’s fundamentals.","After a recent massive run-up in Tesla (TSLA) stock, some on Wall Street are cautioning it’s time to take some money off the table — and investors are indeed taking some profits.
In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near term questions about the stock’s fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn’t exactly trade on fundamentals — it currently trades at a forward price to earnigns ratio (PE) of 80 — Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.
“We believe the stock’s recent rally can be best explained by the market’s current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,” Levy said in his note. “Yet while we aren’t surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.”
In response, Tesla shares are down nearly 6% in midday trading on Wednesday, poised for the stock’s biggest loss in two months.
Levy’s main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla’s recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and most importantly how multiple expansion is really the “entirety of the rally.”
As for AI, the recent run up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company’s ventures like FSD (full self driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a “long-dated” opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.
Similarly Tesla’s charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating “marketing benefits” for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long-term, Levy says.
The biggest factor for the ~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla’s near term fundamentals haven’t changed, and while other AI-related stock have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn’t the case for Tesla.
Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla’s 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla’s margins are still “uncertain” given recent price cuts, though it possible margins may have troughed. Finally more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.
All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla’s prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. “We continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,” Levy says, but “near term fundamentals need to be considered.”

The shares have surged 200% this year as investors see the company well-positioned to take advantage of the AI boom.
The stock jump has seen Nvidia enter the $1 trillion market-cap club, and boosted the wealth of its CEO.
Nvidia's scorching stock rally just hit another milestone.
Shares in the Santa Clara-based chipmaker have extended their 2023 gains to an eye-popping 200% - meaning the price has tripled so far this year. They closed at a record high of $438.08 apiece on Tuesday. The rally has boosted the company's market value by an astounding $723 billion to $1.08 trillion.
The stock surge comes as investors pile into artificial intelligence-related companies including Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet following the smashing debut of OpenAI's human-like chatbot ChatGPT. Nvidia, specifically, has drawn fans as it dominates the market for high-intensity computing infrastructure that's required for AI projects.
The semiconductor firm entered the $1 trillion market-cap club for the first time last month, joining a band of other elite companies with sky-high valuations. The stock rally has also pumped up the wealth of the company's CEO Jensen Huang to $39.2 billion, making him the 34th richest person in the world, per the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.
Morgan Stanley has named Nvidia stock its ""top pick"" and forecast this week that the company's shares could climb a further 15% from current levels.
Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, who has snapped up $220 million of Nvidia stock, has said the shares are worth holding onto for the next few years.
The investor excitement over AI has not helped lift tech stocks in general, boosting the Nasdaq 100 index by about 38% so far this year. But that's got some investors worried about a stock rally that may be too narrow to be sustainable, with Big Tech shares largely fueling the rise of US benchmarks indices, including the S&P 500.","Nvidia stock extends its blistering rally to 200%, adding an eye-watering $723 billion in market value as AI frenzy continues",438.07999,430.45001,430.25,6,2023,21

There are now over 1,400 ESG funds directly holding Nvidia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the latest filings. A further 500 are indirectly exposed, the data show. Nvidia shares hit a record high this week, bringing gains so far in 2023 to about 200%.
The company is now more popular among ESG investors than traditional green powerhouses such as Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Tesla Inc., according to the Bloomberg data. The funds analyzed are registered as either “promoting” ESG, making it their “objective” or simply marketing themselves as ESG.
Nvidia has become an “ESG darling,” said Felix Boudreault, managing partner at Montreal-based Sustainable Market Strategies. And that’s “not ludicrous,” because the company is “exemplary” when it comes to traditional ESG risk management, he said.
Daniel Klier, chief executive officer of sustainability data and technology firm ESG Book, calls Nvidia “one of the best-performing companies in the large-cap universe,” thanks to a high level of ESG disclosures and a business that’s aligned with the critical global warming threshold of 1.5C.
Peter Krull, partner and director of sustainable investing at Earth Equity Advisors, a Prime Capital Investment Advisors company, says Nvidia is “absolutely” a good sustainable investment. “They’re making the steps that big companies need to make to both be lighter on the planet” with their products, and contributing to innovation, he said.
ESG’s growing exposure to tech — and in particular artificial intelligence — has the potential to change the narrative around an investment strategy that last year suffered a number of headwinds. Amid an energy crisis and rising interest rates, ESG found itself the target of political attacks in the US, with Republicans calling it an anti-American form of business and investing that put a “woke” agenda ahead of financial returns.
This year, however, ESG funds’ reliance on tech is driving outperformance. The top ESG funds so far in 2023 are all tech-heavy and invested in AI, and all have returned more than 40%. In Europe, ESG equity funds have delivered about 12% this year on average, compared with gains of roughly 8% in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Among ESG-registered funds with the biggest returns so far in 2023 is one managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (Ticker: TRGBTEA LX), which is up about 46%. Nvidia is its fourth-largest holding, according to Bloomberg data. The fund, whose top three stocks are Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Microsoft Corp., has beaten 97% of peers since the end of December.
An ESG fund run by the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Ticker: JPMUSTC LX) is also up 46%, according to Bloomberg data. Its biggest holdings are Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia.
The Nasdaq 100 Stock Index, whose top three stocks by weightings are Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia, has soared almost 40% this year.
As investors pile into AI, Europe and the US are figuring out how best to rein it in with regulations amid warnings from some of the scientists behind the technology that it may pose a serious threat to society without adequate guardrails.
But Boudreault says that if done right — and with the right regulatory boundaries in place — the “AI revolution” could actually have “massive positive impacts to address the world’s most pressing challenges, be they social or environmental.”
Meanwhile, the mania surrounding AI-related stocks is starting to look overdone to some. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management LLC, said earlier this year she had decided to drop Nvidia as the company faces growing competition. Wood is instead looking “to another set of plays,” she said.

James Penny, the chief investment officer of TAM Asset Management and a veteran investor who correctly predicted the headwinds facing ESG last year, said earlier this month that the current mood around AI is reminiscent of the early days of the tech bubble that burst in 2000 and wiped more than 70% off the Nasdaq.
“I think the market has got a little bit over its skis,” he said in comments first published on June 12. “I’d put much larger odds on it coming down from here.”
If such predictions hold, even companies with robust revenue and earnings models stand to get caught in the fray. The dot-com bubble wiped about 60% off Microsoft’s market value. Since then, however, it’s added roughly 1,500%.
Chasing a market frenzy “is never a good strategy,” said Boudreault. But if the question is whether it makes sense to hold Nvidia from an ESG point of view, then the answer is “increasingly, yes,” he said.

Short Bets on US Stocks Hit $1 Trillion, Most Since April 2022
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd., which makes most, if not all, of the chips designed by Nvidia, is showing a more modest 30% gain. ASML Holding NV, whose extreme ultraviolet lithography systems are essential in the production process, is up 27%.
The contrast in performance reflects Nvidia’s position as the most immediate beneficiary of the demand for technology that powers AI applications. For TSMC and ASML, any gains will be longer term, while in the short run, much of their vast client bases are being hit hard by a slump in global chip demand.
These factors are reflected in estimates of adjusted earnings per share. Over the past six months, analysts have raised current year forecasts for Nvidia by 77%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the same period, estimates for TSMC were trimmed by 15%, while those for ASML held steady.
Nvidia is “expensive for a reason,” said Richard Clode, a portfolio manager with Janus Henderson. “You’ve ultimately got to see upside to earnings and profit forecasts. That’s the only thing that sustainably keeps stocks higher, and the only company we are seeing at the moment is Nvidia.”
Here are four charts showing how Nvidia is pulling clear of peers as the AI frenzy gathers momentum:
Nvidia’s market capitalization has surged past the $1 trillion mark without a pause, taking the firm’s value beyond that of ASML and TSMC combined. It’s now twice as big as ASML, having been worth less as recently as January, and four times larger than TSMC.
Earlier this month, TSMC tempered its annual spending budget, a blow for its equipment supplier ASML, whose quarterly order intake has slumped to the lowest level since 2020.
Trading at 50 times estimated annual earnings, Nvidia is the second most-expensive among profitable members of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, leaving TSMC and ASML far behind.
Heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, which motivated Warren Buffett to close out his position in TSMC, have worked against the Taiwanese chipmaker’s valuation. A US-led effort to restrict China’s access to semiconductor technology has also hit ASML, as the Netherlands readies export curbs on some of its advanced machines.
“The geopolitical side is something that has to be factored into valuation,” said Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.
While analysts have increased estimates of Nvidia’s forward adjusted earnings per share by 79% in the past six months, those for TSMC and ASML have fallen.
Even though TSMC is the sole maker of Nvidia’s AI processors, its revenue may see only a low single-digit percentage boost in the short term, according to Bernstein analysts led by Mark Li. That’s because Nvidia’s processors account for a small portion of TSMC’s revenue, and capacity for packaging these chips is tight.
For ASML, boosts from generative AI won’t come until 2025, said Societe Generale analyst Alexander Peterc. It takes over a year for the Dutch firm to fulfill an order for the EUV equipment that is indispensable to producing the most cutting-edge chips, and these machines are almost fully booked for next year. For 2025, the benefit may amount to 3% additional sales, Peterc estimated.
Nvidia traders have been snapping up options to bet that the stock will rise or fall, sending total speculative interest to the highest level in four years. Wagers on TSMC and ASML’s American depositary receipts have also been rising, but to levels short of their November peaks.

NVDA,2023-06-22 16:47:29,"Tech won't ""roll over until you crack the economy - that's what happened in 1999, that's likely what's going to happen now,"" Chris Harvey told Bloomberg.","Tech stocks' huge rally won't end until the economy ""breaks"", according to Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey.
Only higher interest rates can temper the AI-fueled boom, the strategist told Bloomberg.
""Tech is not going to roll over… until you crack the economy,"" Harvey said.
Only the Federal Reserve can put an end to tech stocks' massive, AI-fueled surge, according to Wells Fargo's top equity strategist.
Further interest-rate increases by the central bank could crack the economy and put an end to the sector's huge start-of-2023 rally, Chris Harvey said Wednesday.
""Tech is not going to roll over, the major theme isn't going to roll over until you crack the economy – that's what happened back in 1999, that's likely what's going to happen now,"" he told Bloomberg, referring to when Fed tightening put an end to the late-1990s dot-com boom.
""I don't think you can crack the economy until the Fed gets more aggressive,"" Harvey added.
Between March 2022 and May 2023, the central bank raised interest rates from near-zero to over 5% in a bid to tame soaring prices.
But it temporarily ""paused"" its tightening campaign earlier this month amid signs that inflation has started to rapidly cool from the four-decade highs it hit last year.
While stocks initially plummeted as investors adjusted to higher rates, both the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have enjoyed spectacular rebounds in 2023, powered higher by massive gains from AI-related stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft.
And only even higher interest rates – which would make borrowing cash more expensive and likely weigh on both spending levels and drag the economy closer to a recession – can end that rally now, Harvey said.
""We'll have some wiggles, I think we'll have a pullback in the market, we'll have a pullback in big tech, but that overall theme is still in place,"" he told Bloomberg.
""Not until the economy breaks do we really think about that trend breaking,"" Harvey added.

But the bank believes any dip will create a buying opportunity for investors.
""Any retracement would present a tactical opportunity,"" strategists said in a research note.
Stocks could dip once the initial hype around artificial intelligence fizzles out - but that would just create an opportunity for investors to buy the dip, according to Barclays.
Benchmark indices including the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have surged over the first five-and-a-half months of 2023 - but most of those gains have come from a small group of mega-cap tech stocks, like Nvidia and Microsoft.
Those high concentration levels will likely lead to stocks giving up some of their stellar early-year gains in the short term before traders are drawn back into tech once AI starts to juice up listed companies' earnings, the British bank said in a note to clients Thursday.
""Historical instances of such narrow stock market leadership suggest that this outperformance is due for a correction in the near term,"" a team of Barclays strategists led by Venu Krishna wrote.
""However, we think any retracement would present a tactical opportunity rather than a structural collapse of the trade, because multiples have not risen to historical extremes and the expanding AI economy should help its primary beneficiaries grow into their valuations,"" they added.
So far, AI's main impact on the stock market has been pushing up valuations, with investors piling into names they think will help build the sector in the wake of the sudden explosion of interest in ChatGPT.
But the early signs suggest the new technology will drive up earnings over the longer term too, according to Barclays.
Semiconductor giant Nvidia strengthened its position as 2023's best-performing S&P 500 stock last month after it released second-quarter revenue forecasts that beat Wall Street's expectations by 50% thanks to soaring demand for its AI chips.
Its shares popped 24% the day after that earnings report - and further gains since mean it's now added over $700 billion to its total valuation year-to-date.

The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon.
That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.
US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in stock market is set to falter.
According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as the continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.
S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.
The bearish sentiment results from skepticism on how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.
But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.
This year, Wall Street has been caught up in hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to ""fear of missing out.""
But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.
Meanwhile, the prospect on continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25%, and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&P 500.
Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.",Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run,430.45001,430.25,422.09,6,2023,22
NVDA,2023-06-22 22:31:55,"Investors were similarly excited about emerging technologies and skeptical of a looming recession during the internet bubble, David Rosenberg said.","David Rosenberg sees shades of the dot-com bubble in the fanfare around tech stocks and the economy.
The veteran economist compares AI hype today to internet mania in the early 2000s.
A recession appears to be a virtual certainty as the US economy runs out of steam, Rosenberg says.
US investors' tech-stock fever and recession skepticism are reminiscent of the dot-com bubble — and could end just as painfully, David Rosenberg has warned.
The veteran economist and Rosenberg Research president listed a bunch of parallels between the internet mania at the turn of this century, and the current hype around artificial intelligence and other technologies, in a LinkedIn post this week.
He pointed to extreme concentration in tech stocks, eye-popping valuations for some growth stocks, and investors shrugging off a crisis (the sudden collapse of Long-Term Capital Management then, the banking fiasco this time around.)
The former chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch also highlighted the S&P 500's resilience, the very tight labor market, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates sharply, the protracted yield-curve inversion, and widespread hopes among investors for a ""soft landing"" both today and before the dot-com crash.
Rosenberg weighed in on AI and the dot-com craze too, suggesting that ""both have enormous economic and productivity influences, but both also involved financial asset bubbles that popped in dramatic fashion.""
Moreover, he cautioned that investors appear overly optimistic today, just as they were nearly 25 years ago. For example, they've roughly tripled Nvidia's stock price this year, lifting its market capitalization to north of $1 trillion. They've also more than doubled the stock prices of Tesla, Meta, and other popular tech names too.
""The smug complacency in 2000 looks eerily similar to what we have on our hands today,"" Rosenberg said, adding that a recession is ""coming sooner than you think.""
He noted the inverted yield curve is signaling a 99% chance of a recession, and based on past economic cycles, that may mean the downturn arrives before the end of this year.
The longtime market commentator also suggested that government stimulus during the pandemic inflated household savings, which have cushioned the impact of steeper borrowing costs and staved off an economic downturn so far.
They ""acted as an antidote to the Fed rate hikes, but this Energizer Bunny is starting to run out of gas,"" he said, pointing to deteriorating business outlooks at several major US retailers and restaurants.
Rosenberg suggested a deteriorating economy could spur the Fed to begin cutting rates by the fourth quarter of this year. Moreover, historic inflation could turn into deflation as the US money supply contracts and bank credit continues to decline, he said.
The Rosenberg Research chief has been sounding the alarm on asset prices and the US economy for several months. He told Insider in February that the S&P 500 might bottom at 3,000 points — 31% below its current level — and house prices could plunge 25% from their peak last year.",Markets guru David Rosenberg says the tech-stock frenzy reminds him of the dot-com bubble - and warns the US economy is barreling towards recession,430.45001,430.25,422.09,6,2023,22

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union industry chief Thierry Breton on Thursday defended draft rules aimed at preventing non-EU governments from gaining illegal access to EU data, saying they were not protectionist.
The draft Data Act, which Breton proposed early last year, is in the final stage of negotiations between the European Commission, EU countries and EU lawmakers. The parties are expected to reach a deal next week on the final details before the legislation is adopted.
It lays out rights and obligations on the use of EU consumer and corporate data generated in smart gadgets and machinery as well as consumer goods, and is the latest in a series of regulations designed to curb the power of U.S. tech giants.
""Our European data strategy is to unlock a wealth of big data and set out how that data should be shared, stored and processed. This will benefit all businesses – European, American and others alike,"" Breton said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the opening of an EU Office in San Francisco.
""Assertiveness is not protectionism,"" he said.
Big U.S. tech companies have said the Data Act could impede international data transfer, and European companies have also criticised it.
Siemens and SAP last month said a provision forcing companies to share data with third parties to provide aftermarket or other data-driven services could endanger trade secrets.
In San Francisco, Breton will meet Twitter-owner Elon Musk, Meta Platform CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. He will seek to persuade them to sign up to his AI Pact that aims to get companies to implement EU AI rules ahead of their enforcement in two years' time.
He also said he would head to Asia next week to discuss the digital agenda and AI with the Korean and Japanese governments, adding Europe had also launched a digital partnership with Singapore.

As a disclaimer, Singh said the content in this video and its description are not financial advice. Those with specific financial questions are recommended to meet with a licensed advisor. Disclaimer aside, here’s how using ChatGPT can position you to become a millionaire.
How To Use ChatGPT To Make More Money
In the video, Singh outlines three ways you can use ChatGPT to make more money:
Invest in the companies creating AI.
Use AI to bring in more income or save your business money.
Own a piece of the companies that are utilizing AI.
I’m a Financial Planning Expert: Here Are 5 Things You Should Never Spend Money on If You Want To Be Rich
Investing in Companies Creating AI
The key to figuring out the answer to this question, Singh said, is to ask ChatGPT which companies are investing in AI. ChatGPT will provide a list of companies investing in artificial intelligence.
According to ChatGPT, this list includes Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia and IBM. Singh compares the list of companies ChatGPT said are investing in AI with a Forbes article about the best AI stocks to buy. Some of the stocks include Adobe, Amazon, IBM and Oracle.
“If you’re going to be investing in companies, don’t just blindly throw your money into companies. Do your research,” Singh said. The next best thing, per Singh’s recommendation, is an exchange-traded fund. (Viewers are recommended by Singh to conduct due diligence before investing.)
Using AI To Increase Your Profits
While AI does not have the most up-to-date information, Singh said he was able to use it to create more fun content within his newsletter.
Singh also highlighted other companies using ChatGPT in a variety of ways. Salesforce, for example, is building its own competitive ChatGPT that can be used to write sales emails to sell its products without requiring a lot of hires.
Own a Piece of the Companies Utilizing AI
If you are not an entrepreneur, Singh said, you can invest in companies utilizing AI.
A good example, Singh said, are startup companies. Online platforms, including Republic, StartEngine or Wefunder, all allow you to invest in startups and look at companies utilizing AI. Singh recommended finding the platform that is best for you.

Together, they’re driving the technology of the future. Semiconductor chips are ubiquitous in our digital age, and AI has in recent months begun transforming the way we communicate with our machines. The convergence of these two fields implies limitless possibilities.
For investors, this is particularly exciting. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the PHLX, which tracks the chip sector through the performance of the 30 largest semiconductor makers, has gained approximately 39% so far this year.”
The PHLX is up for good reason. Semiconductors have been here for decades, and are found in pretty much everything in today’s digital world, but combined with AI, they’ll be driving tomorrow’s technology. Investors have picked up on this, and have made chip makers the go-to for AI stocks.
The question now is, how much more room do the AI chip stocks have to grow? We can consult the Street’s analysts – several top stock pros have been weighing in on AI and semiconductors, and their comments can shed more light on the sector. Let’s take a look at what they have to say, and which AI-related chip giants they’re recommending.
Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
First up is Nvidia, a major name in the semiconductor industry, the eighth largest chip maker by revenue. Nvidia is a leader in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs), and has built its reputation on these high-end chips. The chips are capable of handling the computing power needs of several high-end, processing-intensive applications, including professional graphic design, high-end gaming — and AI. Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, especially in the latter application, has powered the stock’s strong gains this year; for the year-to-date, NVDA shares are up approximately 190%.
Recent data show that Nvidia’s performance is standing on its AI products. OpenAI, the company that launched ChatGPT, has been using Nvidia’s GPUs since 2020 in training its AI units – to the tune of 20,000 chips. Looking ahead, OpenAI has indicated that it may need another 10,000 chips to maintain ChatGPT efficiency.
This is a firm foundation for Nvidia’s success, and the company’s strong position can be inferred from the solid beat it recorded in its recent Q1 financial results. This report showed a total top line revenue of $7.19 billion. While this was down 13% from the prior year, it beat the forecast by an impressive $670 million. The bottom line figure, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.09, was 17 cents per share better than had been anticipated.
Better yet, from an investor’s perspective, was Nvidia’s guidance. The company is predicting $11 billion in sales for its fiscal Q2, a massive increase from its previous guidance of $7.2 billion. Achieving this will translate to a 41% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues.
This company’s strength in AI forms the basis for the upbeat comments by Morgan Stanley’s 5-star analyst Joseph Moore, who writes: “NVDA should trade at a premium to peers given the higher probability of upward revisions near term, but the multiple premium vs. those peers has actually narrowed meaningfully… Nonetheless, we do see continued growth in the NVDA data center business, in a multi-year trajectory that should be clearly above all other compute players on a composite basis, given there is no offsetting or cannibalized compute business outside of the AI business.
“As a result,” the analyst added, “we see NVDA as the cleanest story in AI hardware, and believe it continues to deserve more consideration from investors looking for AI exposure, even if the current valuation construct and YTD stock return already reflects expectations that are higher than secondary or tertiary players.”
To this end, Moore puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on NVDA, which he has promoted to be his Top Pick. In Moore’s view, NVDA will hit $500 by this time next year, implying a gain of 18.5% from current levels. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here)
Overall, Nvidia gets a Strong Buy rating form the Wall Street analysts’ consensus, based on 33 recent reviews that break down to 30 Buys against just 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $422.09 and the $464.85 average price target suggest a modest 10% upside in the next 12 months. (See NVDA stock forecast)
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
AMD, by sales, is perennially one of the top ten largest chip making firms, and saw total revenues of $23.06 billion in the last four quarters (2Q22 through 1Q23). The company boasts a $188 billion market cap, and has a wide portfolio in the AI ecosystem, including high-performance chips and architecture.
AMD’s AI exposure incudes its Instinct GPU accelerators, the Alveo Adaptive accelerators, and the EPYC server processors, as well as several lines of chips, including its Ryzen AI mobile processors, and the Versal AI core adaptive SoCs. AMD’s AI chips and accelerators are found in a wide range of applications, from gaming to data centers to supercomputers, and provide the processing speed and capacity needed for generative AI.
By the numbers, the company’s recent performance was better than been expected. In the first quarter of this year, AMD showed $5.35 billion in total revenues. While that was down about 9% year-over-year, it beat the forecasts by $40 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS bottom line of 60 cents per share also beat the forecast, by 4 cents over the estimates. On the negative side, the company’s Q2 revenue guidance of $5.3 billion was considered weak, and was below the $5.52 billion expectations.
The company’s AI portfolio provides important support for the firm. AMD is shifting its strategic focus to the emerging AI market, and is investing heavily in both networking and data center AI operations. Getting to specifics, AMD’s new Ryzen 7000 series includes AI processing capabilities, and the MI300 chips are designed for both high-performance computing and AI applications. The latter track will find support from the rapidly growing generative AI field.
These are the key points behind Baird analyst Tristan Gerra’s comments on AMD. Gerra, who holds a 5-star rating from TipRanks, says of the company: “Mi300x claims best-in-class TCO performance for inference applications, and management reiterated its expectation for meaningful AI revenue starting in 4Q23 based on multiple hyperscaler engagements. AMD sees a >50% CAGR for data center AI acceleration by 2027, to a $150B+ TAM. While its ecosystem is not as mature as Nvidia, AMD is well positioned to be a key beneficiary of AI secular growth trends for the medium term, in our view.”
Based on the above, Gerra sets an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMD shares, and he gives the stock a price target of $170 to imply a 54.5% upside potential on the 12-month horizon. (To watch Gerra’s track record, click here)
Overall, the Street gives AMD a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 29 recent analyst reviews that include 21 Buys and 8 Holds. The stock’s current trading price is $110.01, and its $134.31 average price target suggests that it will appreciate by 22% in the year ahead. (See AMD stock forecast)

NVDA,2023-06-23 22:18:52,"Wall Street's feverish excitement for AI is saving the S&P 500 every day, Virtus chief market strategist Joe Terranova said.","AI fever will carry the bull market even higher, according to Virtus' Joe Terranova.
Terranova pointed to the strong success of AI stocks this year, which have carried the S&P 500.
The power of generative AI won't be wiped away, even if the US tips into a downturn, he said.
Wall Street's excitement for artificial intelligence will carry the bull market in stocks higher – even as the US is set to tip into a recession, according to veteran trader Joe Terranova.
Virtus Investment's chief market strategist pointed to S&P 500's strong performance this year, with the benchmark index officially entering a bull market in early June.
The index has largely been carried by the outperformance of mega-cap tech stocks, which have jumped amid the AI hype sparked by ChatGPT. Though the S&P 500 is up 15% this year, large tech stocks with plans to capitalize on artificial intelligence have more than doubled since January, with Nvidia up 200% and Meta up 129% from the start of 2023.
""If the bulls are going to be defeated, you have to tell me how is it exactly you're going to break the fever that currently exists in mega-cap equities? Because every day it's saving the tape,"" Terranova said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. ""The script is in place. I've said I think Q3 could be a flat to negative quarter, but on the other side of that, you have the mega-cap put that's in place, and that's going to lead markets to resume the overall positive trend of 2023.""
That upward momentum could carry on even in the face of recession, Terranova said, who was skeptical that the US would be able to stick a soft-landing. A downturn is foretold when looking at key recession indicators, he suggested, pointing to the inverted Treasury yield curve, which notched its steepest inversion in over 40 years.
""That's not a sign of growth in the economy,"" Terranova said. ""[Mega-cap tech] is the only place you can find growth.""
He forecasted that the Fed would raise interest rates further in the second half of the year, but later pull back interest rates due to recession risks.
""That does not mean that you wash away with an eraser the positive catalyst that is generative AI,"" he said of his view on stocks.
Experts have been warning of a potential recession over the past year as central bankers raised interest rates aggressively to combat inflation. Though prices are still well above the Fed's 2% inflation target, rates are now at their highest level since 2007 – a level that could easily overtighten the economy into recession, experts warn.
Markets are pricing in a 72% chance the Fed will hike rates another 25 basis points at their next policy meeting, which would lift the fed funds rate to 5.25-5.5%. Meanwhile, the US has a 71% chance of tipping into a downturn by May 2024, according to an estimate from the New York Fed.","AI fever will carry the bull market higher even as the US tips into recession, veteran trader says",430.25,422.09,406.32001,6,2023,23

Socionext Inc. has jumped more than 260% this year, with its market value touching a high of around ¥957 billion ($6.7 billion), making it the best-performing stock on the Topix index. The surge is part of a global rally in AI-related semiconductor stocks, highlighted by Nvidia Corp.’s surprisingly bullish outlook in May.
The Yokohama-based firm, which was founded through a merger of the systems-on-chip (SOC) divisions of Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd. and Panasonic Holdings Corp. in 2015, develops customized modules for clients across the consumer, automotive and industrial fields.
“This is pretty much the only listed Japanese company that covers a unique field of customized SOC,” said Rina Oshimo, a strategist at Okasan Securities. Because Socionext develops and produces chips only after receiving orders, it has a fundamentally different business model from industry leaders Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., she added.
Socionext develops SOCs for use in electric vehicles, smart devices and data centers, according to its website. The company first debuted on the Tokyo exchange in October, with shares jumping 15% on its debut.
“It’s involved in an area, design of systems-on-chip, which we think has very significant growth potential going forward in autonomous vehicles, mobile, 5G and potentially 6G technologies,” said Richard Aston, portfolio manager of the CC Japan Income & Growth Trust plc., which holds shares in the firm.
The fund sees the company as a long-term investment. “There is also an emphasis from management on paying a dividend and growing that dividend over time,” Aston added.
The meteoric rise has taken a dent in recent days, as the company was downgraded for the first time on Thursday by SMBC Nikko, which said the market rally for fast-scaling firms looked overdone. The stock plunged 18% Thursday, its biggest ever drop. Socionext is covered by eight analysts, with seven buys, one hold and zero sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Earnings prospects are promising and it’s uniquely positioned in the industry,” said Tim Morse, an analyst at Asymmetric Advisors. However its ascent may have been too rapid, and “we wouldn’t be surprised to see further profit-taking in both the sector and this name for now.”

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On.
The AI mania is quickly dividing the market into two halves, those who believe we are in an AI bubble that will not live up to the hype and all the stocks gaining on the back of the AI hype will soon come crashing down, and those who say this time it’s different and companies that are investing in AI products and services will keep enjoying huge gains in the future. AI skeptics believe they’ve seen it before. In 2010, when it was reported that IBM’s Watson system is smart and intelligent enough to beat humans at a quiz, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) shares enjoyed a huge rally. Companies working in neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning domains have also seen similar rallies in the past, only to see their valuations go through correction when investors became realistic and rational.
The dramatic gains a handful of companies made over the past few months on the back of their AI claims are causing some valuation-related worries in the market. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently saw a huge rally after the company gave strong guidance on the back of GPU demand growth caused by the deployment of ChatGPT-like apps. But would it be still wise to invest in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Recently, many analysts shared their opinion that the stock is already reflecting the AI opportunity the company enjoys. Some notable investors also decided to take some profits after the latest rally. For example, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, which had a huge position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) since 2020, recently sold a significant portfolio of its stake in the company, according to Bloomberg. The reason was obviously valuation, as the firm's global chief investment officer Benjamin Melman told Bloomberg:
C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) could be another example for things to come for AI investors. Over the past few years, the company has changed its name and business line multiple times. It has tried its luck in energy (it was once C3 Energy) and Internet of Things (its previous name was C3 IoT) industries. In 2019 it changed its name to C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Its name and ticker “AI” proved to be a gold mine as the stock saw a huge rally this year thanks to the AI boom. It has gained about 220% year to date through June 8. But when C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) recently posted earnings results and gave disappointing guidance, the stock fell.
Interestingly, the debate around whether or not we are in an AI bubble is also dividing billionaires into two camps.
Billionaire Ken Griffin, who has a net worth of over $32 billion, recently shared some interesting thoughts during an event for his hedge fund’s new class of interns event in Florida. While the billionaire agrees AI advances will be consequential and affect several facets of our economy, he believes the hype is overblown when it comes to short-term implications.
The billionaire also shared his thoughts on the threat AI poses to jobs.
Interestingly, though, Griffin believes generative AI will change the computer programming industry.
Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller also has some interesting thoughts on AI and his stance is in line with AI enthusiasts as the billionaire is adjusting his portfolio to focus on AI companies. Druckenmiller’s fund upped its stake in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 36% in the first quarter, ending the period with a $220 million stake.
At a recent Bloomberg Invest conference, the billionaire reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said that “Nvidia is something we're going to want to own for at least two or three years, not for 10 months.”
Druckenmiller believes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good choice for the long term even if the company faces some short-term headwinds.

1. The excitement around ChatGPT, AI, and related tech stocks is old news now, but Wall Street can't stop talking about it.
The business world has been single-minded when it comes to AI, and that's led to strong stock performances for once-little-known names like C3.ai, as well as giants like Nvidia.
But all the hubbub may actually be obscuring some serious risks to the US economy, as my colleague Zahra Tayeb writes.
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, for example, by 500 basis points in 15 months — the steepest trajectory in decades. Benchmark rates are currently hovering at the highest mark since 2007, just before the global financial crisis began.
The Fed's own recession probability model shows there's a 70% chance of a downturn by this time next year.
Some investors are also concerned that elevated borrowing costs could soon bring pain to stocks, especially if the central bank makes another rate hike or two. Elon Musk, Nouriel Roubini, and a chorus of Wall Street firms have issued dire warnings.
But the tech sector's strength over recent months — thanks to AI — seems to have muted fears of a recession. That could be a big blind spot.
""Given all other things being equal, such a scenario will likely trim corporates' budgets and demand for technology hardware and software upgrades that could put a dampening effect on the current bout of AI optimism,"" OANDA analyst Kelvin Wong wrote in a recent note.
Outside the US, too, there's reason for concern.
China's massive economy is facing a bleak growth outlook and a weaker-than-expected pandemic rebound.
The country's slowing trade, weak industrial production numbers, and piling debt all ultimately present problems for Wall Street, which may be catching on to the risk.
The S&P 500 just posted a losing week after five straight weeks of gains. The Nasdaq also had a negative week, ending an eight-week winning streak.

AMD Is Making Big Promises
Year-to-date, AMD stock skyrocketed 87% mainly thanks to its AI momentum because its hardware can run and develop AI models, giving it massive growth potential with its ability to supply chips to the entire market. However, AMD is behind Nvidia on this front and it recently revealed its most advanced graphics processing unit GPU to boost its competitiveness. Besides promising to challenge Nvidia’s flagship H100 across several measures, the new MI300 chip will be powering the world's fastest supercomputer whose online debut is expected later this year. Reuters reported that the cloud titan, Amazon Web Services, is considering to use AMD-made hardware. AMD's prospects in AI have grown stronger after Microsoft supported its AI expansion with financial and engineering resources.
Microsoft Is Reinventing Itself With AI
Microsoft got its AI glory back in 2019 due to investing $1 billion in the start-up that created ChatGPT. Open AI models that Microsoft integrated across its offerings provided the company with a massive competitive advantage over Amazon and Google. Its CEO, Satya Nadella continues to reinvent the software titan and he is using AI on his quest. Microsoft Chairman and CEO dreams of an AI world where every citizen on the planet having an AI doctor, tutor and maybe even a consultant so there's no doubt about the direction where Microsoft is going.
Amazon Is Using Its Core Powers For AI Leadership
AWS' leading 32% market share in the cloud industry makes Amazon well-positioned to profit significantly from the development of AI. Moreover, the e-commerce titan has long used this technology to increase the efficiency of its operations and quality of service to its shoppers. Amazon online retail website utilizes AI to provide product recommendations, as well as to determine when specific products will be in demand to optimize its fulfillment centers. Therefore, Amazon’s competitive power in AI actually comes from its e-commerce and cloud leadership.
Nvidia Will Still Be Running The Generative AI Chip Playground For The Foreseable Future
By the time AMD’s new chip becomes available at the beginning of 2024, Nvidia’s H100 will have already been in the market for a year and a half, which gives it plenty of edge. AMD and Intel are in fact betting on an evolution in the generative AI market to lift demand for other types of processors but they are also facing a scary software challenge. Nvidia’s chips are widely used due to the ease with which its GPUs, that were originally designed for video gaming, can be programmed to perform other tasks thanks to the Cuda software. This is why analysts such as Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein, believe that there will be a decade before Nvidia’s rivals can catch up, but during this time, it’s certain that Nvidia will continue working to cement its leadership. For the time being, the booming generative AI chips market belongs to Nvidia. But even Intel was once an undisputable leader that is now far behind both Nvidia and AMD, despite its undergoing strategy shift. While the once-leader who aspires to make the best CPU and the best GPU on the market brings out its Nvidia-contender in 2025, Nvidia will probably get another chip out. By the looks of it, the not-so-distant AI chip future belongs to Nvidia.

""The money has already been made in the hope for what AI is going to be,"" Bianco told Fox Business.
On a separate note, he added Americans are likely seeing this year's lows in inflation right now.
Artificial-intelligence stocks may prove unprofitable in the future as investors have already made money on them from this year's hyped-up rally, according to 40-year market veteran Jim Bianco.
""What happens with these stocks is they discount the future. So AI could very well be the hype that we think, but you could very well be buying these AI stocks and in several years from now, wind up not making any money because the money has already been made in the hope for what AI is going to be,"" the president of Bianco Research said in an interview with Fox Business.
Bianco used the example of Amazon stock, which took many years to make a new high following a sharp fall in the late 1990s after founder Jeff Bezos unveiled his vision for a boom in online retailing.
""That did happen. But if you bought the stock, it took you 12 years to make money,"" Bianco said of investors in Amazon stock.
This year has seen a surge in investor excitement over AI stocks, following the stunning debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It's seen investors pump money into popular tech stocks including Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia, boosted company valuations, and inflated the wealth of several tech CEOs.
Bianco's forecast of AI stocks is at odds with that of several industry bulls. For example, the AI revolution could send the stock market to record highs as it'll boost productivity levels, according to Goldman Sachs.
Aside from AI, Bianco also commented on US inflation, saying price pressures are bottoming out right now. ""We're seeing maybe the lows of the year right now,"" he said. Inflation has dropped from its mid-2022 highs, rising by 4.0% through May, thanks to the Federal Reserve's relentless interest rate hikes over the past year.","AI stocks could prove unprofitable in the future as money has already been made on them in the current rally, 40-year market veteran Jim Bianco says",422.09,406.32001,418.76001,6,2023,26
NVDA,2023-06-27 00:00:58,Nvidia and Snowflake are entering a partnership that will let Snowflake customers build custom generative AI models.,"Nvidia (NVDA) and Snowflake (SNOW) have announced a new partnership that will allow the cloud services company’s more than 8,000 customers to build their own generative AI assistants. The move, which the companies announced during a fireside chat between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman at the Snowflake Summit on Monday.
The move will allow Snowflake’s users to build its own custom AI models using their internal data. That’s a big deal for businesses that want to take advantage of large language models and generative AI, and need to get specific, company-centric answers to their own queries.
That means Snowflake’s customers will be able to do, among other things, build their own generative AI chatbots to pull information from their vast information databases.
Nvidia provides the underlying toolkit, called NeMO, which provides a foundational large language model that Snowflake customers then customize using their own data. Nvidia will also provide the infrastructure including graphics processing units that customers will need to train their generative AI models.
In May, the graphics chip maker announced a somewhat similar partnership with ServiceNow (NOW). Rather than allowing customers to train their own generative AI models, however, ServiceNow trains the models itself. The idea is to give customers a quick means of taking advantage of generative AI capabilities without necessarily having to train the platforms on their own data.
This isn’t the first type of program to allow companies to build out their own generative AI apps. In May, Microsoft (MSFT) announced the launch of its Azure AI Studio, which allows Microsoft customers to create custom AI-powered apps called copilots. Copilots, like Snowflake’s offering, can take a number of forms including running as chatbots.
Generative AI exploded onto the scene when OpenAI released ChatGPT in Nov. 2022. Since then companies ranging from Microsoft to Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have released products or discussed working on the technology.
But Nvidia, which has been investing in developing both chips designed to run AI systems and the software that powers them, has easily been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the boom.
The company’s shares are up 159% over the last 12 months, and 189% year-to-date. The reason? Nvidia is the go-to company when it comes to AI chips. That’s because it turns out, graphics chips are exceptionally good at performing the kind of parallel processing required for AI.
Sure, AMD has its own graphics capabilities, and Intel is building out its AI offerings, but Nvidia is at the top of the heap. And for the foreseeable future, it's going to stay there.

OAKLAND, California (Reuters) - Snowflake a cloud data analytics company, is partnering with computing company Nvidia to allow customers ranging from financial institutions to healthcare and retail to build AI models using their own data.
The two companies announced the partnership at Snowflake Summit 2023 on Monday.
""In the old days, in small data computing, you moved data to the computer,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters. ""But when you have giant amounts of data like Snowflake does, and the pile of proprietary data ... data that's so valuable to a company, then you move the compute to the data.""
In this case, Nvidia is taking a ""fairly engineering intensive"" move of embedding its NeMo platform for training and running generative AI models into the Snowflake Data Cloud, said Huang.
The partnership comes as chatbot ChatGPT has pushed many companies to find their AI strategies and has propelled Nvidia, which provides the main hardware for AI, to becoming a trillion dollar company.
""This is significant. This is the last mile that we've been waiting for 40 years,"" said Frank Slootman, Chairman and CEO of Snowflake. ""Every industry is on this. They used to say software is eating the world. Well, now data is eating software,"" he said about the importance of data today.
Slootman said companies that use Snowflake to manage their data will be able to now use their own data to train new AI models to gain an advantage in business without risking losing control of it.
No financial details of the partnership were disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia would benefit as more customers use computing for AI work.
""We sell more chips, and we have an operating system for AI called Nvidia AI Enterprise. And that operating system makes it possible for our chips to process AI,"" said Huang. Nvidia charges customers for the use of its Nvidia AI Enterprise software.

""Valuation is full. Tesla trades at a higher multiple than other fast growing tech companies,"" Goldman said.
Tesla stock is poised for a slowdown after its eye-popping year-to-date surge of 105%, according to a Sunday note from Goldman Sachs.
The bank downgraded Tesla stock to ""Neutral"" and said its ""valuation is full"" following its recent rally, according to the note.
But that doesn't mean Goldman is bearish on Tesla going forward. The bank highlighted a number of positive catalysts that could sustain long-term growth rates for the EV maker, including its recent opening of its charging network to competing auto companies, and the potential launch of an affordable EV priced closer to $20,000.
""Overall we believe our view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets, is now better reflected in the stock,"" Goldman Sachs' Mark Delaney said. ""Valuation is full. Tesla trades at a higher multiple than other fast growing tech companies"" like Nvidia and AMD.
Delaney said that he expects Tesla's second-quarter vehicle deliveries to post close to consensus estimates of about 450,000, and that the launch of new products like the Cybertruck and a refreshed Model 3 represent tailwinds for the company.
But at the same time, recent car price reductions from Tesla are likely to continue to have a negative impact on Tesla's profit margins and should hold down the stock for now.
""We are also cognizant of the difficult pricing environment for new vehicles that we think will continue to weigh on Tesla's automotive non-GAAP gross margin this year,"" Delaney said.
The margin pressures combined with Tesla's high valuation gives Delaney comfortability in his downgrade call on the stock. Tesla stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 53x, which is more than Nvidia's 41x.
But Goldman could turn more bullish on Tesla stock if the company meaningfully ramps up the production of its third generation vehicle platform, that could include an affordable car, or if the company makes faster progress with its full-self-driving and artificial intelligence products.
Delaney increased his Tesla 12-month price target to $248 from $185, representing potential downside of less than 1% from current levels.

(Reuters) - Reka, an AI model startup founded by former researchers from Alphabet's DeepMind, has raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding from investors including Yuri Milner's DST Global and Snowflake, the companies told Reuters.
The valuation of the deal was not disclosed. A source familiar with the matter said it valued Reka, which launched last year and has no revenue yet, at about $300 million.
Reka focuses on building large and specialized AI models for enterprise customers. Snowflake, which invested in the company, also announced a partnership to allow users to run third-party model providers like Reka within their Snowflake account.
""The bigger opportunity is how we take some of these smaller, more customized models and be able to bring them to run inside Snowflake so that we can give customers the guarantee that if you're using this model, the privacy of your data is guaranteed,"" said Christian Kleinerman, Senior Vice President of Product at Snowflake, which also announced a partnership with Nvidia to give enterprises Nvidia's software stack to build AI models.
The partnerships came as Snowflake competitor Databricks acquired AI model training company MosacicML in a $1.3 billion deal on Monday.
""We don't see the need to go and buy anything like that. We have a really awesome set of partners,"" said Kleinerman.
Reka will use the funding to acquire computing power from Nvidia, as well as build a business team, according to chief executive Dani Yogatama.
Reka enters a crowded field of building large language models for enterprise uses, as companies race to figure out how to adopt the AI system that powered the popularity of ChatGPT into corporate settings to increase efficiency.
Yogatama said Reka differentiated by building both large models and proprietary model distillation technology to downsize models for specific use cases. Its models also support both text and image.
""I think small models are going to represent a massive paradigm shift as enterprises are getting more serious about deploying AI models at scale,"" said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures, who sits on Reka's board.

San Francisco (Reuters) - MLCommons, a group that develops benchmark tests for artificial intelligence (AI) technology, on Tuesday unveiled results for a new test that determines system speeds when training algorithms used for chatbots like ChatGPT - and Nvidia came out on top.
The MLPerf benchmark is based on GPT-3, an AI model used to train ChatGPT, the viral chatbot developed by OpenAI and backed by Microsoft. However, because the model is huge, the benchmark only uses a representative portion.
""This was our most expensive benchmark so far,"" MLCommons Executive Director David Kanter told Reuters. ""We spent over 600K hours of accelerator compute time to develop it, plus some fantastically talented engineers.""
Kanter declined to disclose the cost of development, only saying it was in the millions of dollars.
Only two chip firms - Nvidia and Intel's Habana Labs - submitted results for the benchmark, with the fastest time coming from systems using the latest H100 chip from Nvidia, the uncontested leader in hardware for training AI.
Nvidia's largest system submitted in partnership with AI cloud startup CoreWeave used 3,584 H100 chips, resulting in a training time of 10.94 minutes. Habana Labs, an AI chip company acquired by Intel, ran the benchmark in 311.945 minutes with a much smaller system equipped with 384 Gaudi2 chips.
Generally, more chips and a bigger system mean faster training.
Intel's Jordan Plawner, senior director of AI Products, said the results demonstrated the potential of Gaudi2, which will have a software update in September to boost speed.
""You will get a 1.5X to 2X speed up on the Habana results. So that's when we see Habana Gaudi2 being really competitive and lower priced than H100,"" Plawner told Reuters.
Plawner declined to say how much a Gaudi2 chip costs, but said the industry needs a second supplier of chips for AI training, and the MLPerf results show Intel can fill that need.

Its plunge underscores fears that the country's stagnating economy could drag down global growth.
Mega-cap US companies like Nvidia and Tesla are also majorly exposed to China.
The Chinese yuan is plummeting against its main rival the US dollar, fueling worries that a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy will drag on global growth.
The renminbi fell as much as 0.6% Monday to just under 7.22 yuan per dollar, trading at a seven-month low versus the greenback.
The yuan's plunge against its US counterpart comes even though the Federal Reserve paused its interest-rate hiking campaign last week, which would typically be expected to weigh on the latter currency by denting its appeal to foreign investors seeking higher yields.
The renminbi's fall has coincided with increased worries about the health of China's economy after Beijing ended its hardline zero-COVID restrictions late last year, with industrial production slowing and import and export levels tumbling in 2023.
That's reignited fears about a wider slowdown in global growth, due to China's role as a major player in international trade and massive source of demand for goods and services.
Some analysts also worry that the slump could temper US stocks' breakneck rally, with surging mega-cap names like Nvidia and Tesla among the companies that are most-exposed to China, according to data from Bank of America.
The People's Bank of China – which slashed key interest rates earlier this month in a bid to revive growth – responded to the renminbi's fall by fixing the tightly-managed onshore yuan at a rate above market expectations on both Monday and Tuesday.
The central bank pegs the currency pegged against the greenback within a narrow range, rather than allowing for it to trade via a floating exchange rate.
The onshore yuan rose around 0.3% Tuesday, to trade at just over 7.21 yuan per dollar.

The short seller notes that many tech companies are far more aggressively valued today than in 1995.
Chanos is a longtime skeptic of high-flying tech stocks and has repeatedly bet against them.
Many people are hailing artificial intelligence as a transformative technology that will rival the internet revolution of the late 1990s, and supercharge the value of the companies leading the way. Jim Chanos poured cold water on their hopes in a Monday tweet.
""For those of you that think this is tech's 1995 moment, consider that $CSCO traded at less than 4x its FY 1996 revenues, at the end of 1995,"" the famed short seller tweeted, using Cisco's ticker. Microsoft and Intel were also valued at less than 6 times and 4 times their respective revenues for 1996 at that time, he noted.
Chanos was likely nodding to a research note on the ""AI Gold Rush"" published by Wedbush analysts on Monday. ""We view this as a '1995 Internet Moment' … NOT a 1999 Dot.Bubble Moment,"" they wrote, adding that an AI spending boom could send tech stocks up another 15% this year.
The Chanos & Company president's tweet suggests he sees less upside for tech stocks now than in 1995, as valuations are significantly higher today compared to almost 30 years ago.
Indeed, Microsoft's current $2.4 trillion market capitalization is more than 12 times the $198 billion of revenue it earned last year. Another big player in AI, Nvidia, commands a $1 trillion market cap - 37 times its $27 billion of revenue last year.
Excitement around AI has helped boost the Nasdaq Composite by 27% this year. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy stock index soared more than six-fold between the start of 1995 and the peak of the dot-com bubble in early 2000. Chanos' tweet signals he's doubtful that tech stocks will keep soaring, as they've already seen an aggressive run up and may have priced in the benefits of AI to their businesses.
The veteran investor, best known for sniffing out fraud at Enron and WorldCom then betting on their stocks to fall, has been openly skeptical about the AI craze and the wider tech boom. For example, his fund held bearish put options on Beyond Meat, Carvana, Nvidia, and dozens of other stocks at the end of March, its latest portfolio update shows.","Don't expect the AI frenzy to supercharge tech stocks and spark another dot-com boom, short seller Jim Chanos says",406.32001,418.76001,411.17001,6,2023,27

Investors should get ready for another massive, artificial intelligence-fueled rally that powers up tech stock prices, according to Wedbush's Dan Ives.
The analyst said Monday that he's expecting the explosion of interest in AI to start lifting a broader group of tech stocks, with most of the stock market's year-to-date gains currently concentrated in a small grouping of mega-cap names.
""This is the start of a new bull market for tech, and I think ultimately it's going to be broader,"" Ives told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"". ""It's not just those seven or eight Big Tech stocks – we believe that fundamentals are not just stabilizing, but starting to see upticks for the first time.""
AI has emerged as a key tailwind for stocks in 2023, with the explosion of interest in ChatGPT inspiring investors to load up on shares in related companies.
The new investing theme has boosted the benchmark S&P 500 by 13% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite by 27% this year – although most of those returns have come from a select group of blue-chip companies.
Nvidia has jumped 178% in 2023 to become a trillion-dollar company for the first time, while Meta Platforms and Tesla have also racked up triple-digit gains.
The AI boom hasn't yet lifted smaller-cap tech stocks to the same extent – but Ives expects that'll soon change.
In a separate research note published Monday, the analyst predicted that the rise of AI will lead to $800 billion of extra spending this year – and compared the emergence of the tech to the rise of the Internet in 1995.

Still, the company has stood out by finding opportunity in niche markets, the NYU finance professor tweeted.
Nvidia's stellar 178% stock surge has been the highlight of this year's US equity-market rally, with investors betting the chipmaker will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial-intelligence boom.
But even a 10-fold jump in revenues and operating margins approaching 40% over the next decade would translate into a share price of only $240, well below the current market level of around $410, according to NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, who earned the nickname 'Dean of Valuation' for his focus on estimating the value of assets.
A value per share of $400 or more is possible if Damodaran replaced point estimates, which express the projection as a single value, with distribution estimates that reflect his uncertainty - but it's still unlikely, he said in a lengthy Twitter thread on Friday.
While the semiconductor industry saw a drop in growth over the last 20 years, Nvidia has remained opportunistic, according to Damodaran. It has continued to grow and rake in high profits by getting ahead in niche markets, he said, citing its forays into gaming and crypto in the last decade and AI recently.
""My NVIDIA story is built around a dominant market share of a growing AI market and a sizable market share of Auto chip market, in conjunction with continued, albeit slackening growth, in its more traditional markets,"" he tweeted.
AI will likely bring about ""extraordinary changes"" to financial markets and everyday life, according to Damodaran. But going by history, only a few players will win big and that will ""cause investors more disappointment than hope - especially if they buy into buzzwords,"" according to him.

Investors should pile into high-growth and mega-cap tech stocks over the second half of this year because of the looming threat of a recession, according to a top Citigroup strategist.
Stuart Kaiser said Monday that he believes that the US economy is barreling towards an economic slump – but that environment ""should be relatively favorable to tech"", with limited returns available elsewhere on the stock market.
""You've got very high cash yields, you've got recession risks kind of in the background, and that's the main driver of people wanting to be in large-cap tech and growth stocks,"" Kaiser, who is Citi's head of US equity trading strategy, told CNBC.
""Essentially, there's a scarcity of growth and people are willing to pay a premium to be in them,"" he added. ""So from our perspective, the key to unlocking that trade is you need growth to broaden out, which effectively means recession risks come down.""
Citi strategists expect the US economy to have slipped into a recession by the end of the year.
The mega-cap growth stocks favored by Kaiser have already started the year on a tear thanks to the rise of AI and the Federal Reserve easing up on its interest-rate hikes.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares hesitated on Wednesday as surprisingly upbeat U.S. economic news warred with global growth concerns, while the embattled yen hit a 15-year low on the euro and Japan hinted at intervention to prevent further losses.
The strength of U.S. data also combined with hawkish commentary from the European Central Bank to undermine bonds as markets narrowed the odds on further rate hikes.
That only heightened attention on a star-studded panel of central bankers later in the day in Portugal which includes Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ECB head Christine Lagarde and Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda.
""The U.S. data signals continued resilience in interest rate sensitive sectors, and the Fed is very clear that a period of sub-trend activity may be needed to bring inflation under control,"" said analysts at ANZ. ""So far, that doesn't seem to be happening.""
""For the ECB, senior officials signalled the need for ongoing tightening unless core inflation slows materially and a September rate hike is looking increasingly on the cards.""
The rate risk kept markets cautious and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed.
Chinese blue chips dipped 0.2%, having bounced on Tuesday as officials talked up the prospects for growth.
Japan's Nikkei outperformed with a rise of 0.7%, aided by the weakness of the yen.
Nasdaq futures eased 0.4%, dragged by a Wall Street Journal report Washington was considering new restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence chips to China. Shares in Nvidia fell 3% after the bell.
S&P 500 futures dipped 0.2%, though that followed solid gains on Tuesday as U.S. data on housing, durable goods orders and consumer sentiment handily topped expectations.
""The data indicated a firmer pace of residential, inventory, and equipment investment in the second quarter,"" wrote analysts at Goldman Sachs. ""We boosted our Q2 GDP tracking estimate by 0.4pp to +2.2%.""
That resilience offset recent softness in manufacturing surveys and led the market to narrow the odds on a July rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
Futures now imply around a 77% chance of a hike to 5.25-5.5%, and slightly more risk of a further move to 5.5-5.75%, which nudged short-term Treasury yields higher.
EURO ON THE RISE
Bond yields also moved sharply higher in Europe after a bevy of central bankers sounded hawkish on inflation and warned rates would likely have to stay higher for longer.
Markets imply a 90% probability of a rate hike to 3.75% in July and a peak around 4.0%.
The euro responded by climbing to $1.0957, while surging on the low-yielding yen to a 15-year peak of 157.97.
The dollar rose to a near eight-month peak of 144.18 yen, before easing back to 143.87 as Japanese officials again protested the weakness in the yen.
Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Wednesday warned against further falls in the yen, saying authorities would take an appropriate response if moves became excessive.
Markets are wary in case Japan intervenes to buy the yen as they did last October, when they knocked the dollar down from a top of 151.94 to as low as 144.50 in a matter of hours.
Yet, a rally in the yen looks unlikely while the Bank of Japan maintains its super-easy monetary policy.
""Following BOJ Governor Ueda's consistently dovish message and weak Japanese wage growth, market participants now lack the conviction the BOJ will soon tighten its monetary policy,"" said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at CBA.
""So we now see a higher risk Japanese authorities will step into the market to prop up the JPY.""

Nvidia, which gets about a fifth of its revenue from China, slid as much as 3.2% in after-hours trading in New York. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell about 3%. The two lead the market for chips vital to the development of generative AI models such as ChatGPT. In China, traders unloaded a slew of AI-related stocks, pushing Inspur Electronic Information Industry Co. and Unisplendour Corp. — both key hardware suppliers — down 10%.
Nvidia this year designed less-capable chips that fall under thresholds that require a license from the Commerce Department before export to China or other countries of concern. Washington is now weighing action as soon as next month to expand the curbs to include those lower-powered semiconductors, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources.
Such a move underscores the Biden administration’s determination to contain China’s technological rise and could stoke tensions between the two countries. The US is increasingly concerned about Beijing’s technological ambitions, including around the use of AI in military and scientific advances that could tilt the geopolitical balance.
While that’s likely to hurt Nvidia’s and AMD’s business with the world’s No. 2 economy, the two chipmakers remain at the forefront of a surge in AI development that’s driving investment from the US to Europe and China. From Microsoft Corp. to Baidu Inc. and ChatGPT developer OpenAI, companies around the world are buying their products to train the next generation of artificial intelligence services.

US officials are also weighing whether to restrict the leasing of cloud services to Chinese AI companies, which have employed such platforms in training their models, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft are among the world’s biggest cloud service providers. Nvidia declined to comment on the Journal report.
“Chinese AI firms may also be able to source dedicated AI chips from third party countries. So I think it will be hard for US to enforce the regulations,” said Robert Lea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While further restrictions could delay AI developments by Chinese firms, I don’t see a major long-term impact as Chinese firms taken an increasingly innovative approach to workarounds.”

The world’s most valuable chipmaker has a more than 80% share of the market for so-called data center accelerator chips, and had been operating under rules that required approval for shipments to China of its A100 and new H100 parts. It was able to partially alleviate the impact on its finances by selling a modified version of the A100 that’s slower at accessing data, and therefore didn’t trigger the restriction.
An AI accelerator is a graphics processor, or GPU, tailored to train AI models by feeding them tons of data. It’s better suited for such tasks than a general-purpose CPU because its architecture can do parallel work in huge volumes. Nvidia was the first to come up with a language to make GPUs do AI tasks, giving it a huge headstart over rivals like AMD and Intel Corp.
AMD was also subject to the initial rules announced last August. While Nvidia’s much smaller rival emerged largely unscathed by the clampdown, Nvidia said in September the restrictions would cost it $400 million in that quarter.
The report “may have hurt sentiment today,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee.

The People's Bank of China seems to like being enigmatic, throwing the market a curve ball as it fixed the yuan weaker against the dollar than many expected. Dealers had thought the firmer fix on Tuesday meant Beijing was signalling it wanted the yuan's fall to slow, or even stop. Now, not so much.
The result has been a drop in the offshore yuan back toward Monday's trough, while the market waits for some clarity on Beijing's intentions.
Sentiment was also not helped by a Wall Street Journal report that Washington is considering new restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence chips to China, which shaved 3% off Nvidia's share price.
The rest of Asia would certainly appreciate a steadier yuan since its fall puts pressure on their currencies to depreciate, to keep their exports competitive with China. Malaysia is set to be the latest to intervene to support its currency, and Japan sounds closer to pulling the trigger every day.
""We are closely watching currency moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Japan's top currency diplomat warned, which is about as close as the Ministry of Finance gets to an outright ultimatum.
The last time the MOF intervened, in 2022, they sold a thumping $43 billion of dollars in just two days, so the threat is not to be sniffed at. It was enough to stall the dollar at 144.0 yen, while the euro eased off a 15-year high on the yen.
Still, the market is clearly betting the yen will keep falling unless, and until, the Bank of Japan backs away from its yield curve policy. Bank of Japan chief Ueda speaks later today at the European Central Bank's Sintra jamboree, and will have to justify his super-easy policy while every other central bank on the panel is busy tightening.
It will also be interesting to see if ECB chief Lagarde expands on the idea that firms should stop padding their margins by raising prices - a variation of the argument that this is a profit-price spiral rather than a wage-price spiral.
Once this would have been scorned as a radical view of the far-left fringe, but it's increasingly gaining mainstream acceptance. An OECD study earlier this month argued that profits were a major driver of inflation, especially in the energy and agriculture sectors.
It's tempting to think that, if wages are not the culprit, then central banks might not have to push unemployment up as much as in the past to curb inflation. Yet, Lagarde's conclusion was that policy would need to be tighter for longer so as to hurt demand enough that firms restrained their hunger for profits. That's still a recipe for higher unemployment.
On the bright side, Australian data out Wednesday did show CPI inflation slowing by more than expected to a 13-month low, and that followed a sharp slowdown in Canadian inflation. So maybe there's hope yet.
Key developments that could influence markets on Wednesday:
- ECB President Christine Lagarde, Fed's Jerome Powell, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey take part in ECB panel in Sintra, Portugal, 1230 GMT
- U.S. data on wholesale and retail inventories, advance goods trade balance

NVDA,2023-06-28 09:33:45,Wall Street analysts are staying with Nvidia stock as a buy despite fresh concerns about China exports.,"Wall Street is sticking with an AI darling despite fresh concerns about demand from key market China.
Shares of graphics chipmaker Nvidia fell about 5% in pre-market trading on Wednesday after reports that the US is planning to impose new curbs on shipments of AI chips to China. Nvidia was the number one trending ticker on the Yahoo Finance platform.
AMD shares traded down around 4% in sympathy. The company recently unveiled its own set of AI chips to take aim at Nvidia's dominance (more on those chips above from a chat with AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su).
The reports say the export curb could begin in July.
Nvidia shares have exploded 186% year to date — taking its market cap to above $1 trillion — as it has assumed pole position in the development of next-generation chips that support generative AI. Just this week, the company inked another deal for its powerful AI chips with cloud services provider Snowflake.
Nvidia's chips already fuel the tech behind OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard chatbots.
Here is Wall Street's early vibe on how an export ban may impact shares of high-flying Nvidia.
""Obviously we will have to await more clarity from the DOC (as soon as early July), but in the meantime we do not believe this derails the bull thesis given AI’s global proliferation and NVDA’s positioning as the key enabler. Our best guess on DC Domestic China exposure is likely ~10-15%+/- of revenue (given expected impact with A100 ban, overall company China exposure looking back [noting gaming has been ~25% China], and recognition of the meaningful uplift from US hyperscalers through the year) - and we note that third party sources have estimated H800 accounting for ~5% of CY23 units (we think implying 5-10% of revenues given higher ASP). Overall, with a more targeted approach to restrictions and NVDA’s proven agility, we do not expect this to be a big deal for NVDA.” — EvercoreISI analyst C.J. Muse
""Reuters reported after the market close today that Commerce Department is considering new restrictions on exports of AI chips by Nvidia and other chip makers to China including Nvidia's A800 chips which met export control requirements last year. While Nvidia talked about a $400M impact from US restrictions last year and has not updated China data center exposure this year, we believe the China AI demand has likely increased this year from gen AI adoption. We estimate China data center sales in the 5-10% range of total $30B data center sales this year. We note that Nvidia's next public opportunity to comment on this topic would likely be on the 9am PT webcast tomorrow where the CFO and SVP of networking will present and discuss the topic of ""Networks for AI"". Overall, we believe AI demand will exceed supply this year and Nvidia can move its chips around. Maintain Buy."" — Citi's Atif Malik

Eyeing another slew of impressive U.S. economic soundings, the world's four most powerful central bankers are set to give a collective take on Wednesday on their final policy push to rein in inflation.
Markets are torn between embracing the resilience of U.S. activity and the likelihood that robust demand will embolden western central banks to tighten credit another few notches to ensure inflation rates do eventually return to 2% targets.
The picture was complicated further overnight as Tuesday's macro-driven rally in Wall St stocks was sideswiped by renewed Sino-U.S. trade tensions. AI darling Nvidia recoiled 4% in out-of-hours trade after reports Washington is considering new curbs on chip exports to China.
But Wednesday's trading may well be dominated by news from a power panel at the European Central Bank's annual forum in Portugal.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ECB boss Christine Lagarde, Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda and Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey all speak at the same set piece at 1330GMT.
The prospect of more policy tightening from all four by year-end has sobered up markets, which were until recently convinced that the steep interest rate rises of the past 18 months could be partly reversed into recessionary conditions in late 2023.
Even though disinflation is proceeding apace - with price pressures in Australia and Canada surprising to the downside this week and euro zone numbers due on Thursday - the prospect of any monetary easing this year now seems a distant prospect.
A sweep of U.S. economic updates on Tuesday showed consumer confidence racing ahead last month, capital goods orders rising and further evidence of an impressive rebound in the U.S. housing markets. President Joe Biden is due to deliver a keynote speech on the economy in Chicago on Wednesday.
While the S&P500 recorded its best day in almost two weeks on Tuesday with gains of over 1%, Treasury bond yields backed up. Two-year yields are back above 4.7% and futures markets now don't price a full policy rate cut from current levels for almost a year, with at least one more hike in the interim.
Partly hampered by the chip wars report, Wall St stock futures gave up some of their gains, with Shanghai earlier ending in the red too. Japan's Nikkei outperformed with gains of more than 2%, while European stocks also advanced.
In currency markets, the dollar was firmer - especially against China's yuan, which hit a new low for the year.
Although the People's Bank of China appeared to support the currency on Tuesday, it seemed to step back again today and endorse the move.
Profits at China's industrial firms extended a double-digit decline in the first five months as softening demand squeezed margins, increasing pressure for more policy support to bolster a stuttering post-COVID economic recovery.
Elsewhere, investors will keep a close eye on the Fed's release of its latest U.S. bank stress tests. The big financial firms are expected to fare well despite the year's troubles at smaller regional banks.
Events to watch for later on Wednesday:
* U.S. May trade balance, May wholesale/retail inventories
* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Bank of Japan's governor Kazuo Ueda and Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey speak at annual ECB central banking forum in Portugal

""It's a calculated bet in the fight against inflation – but at some point, the pain of higher borrowing costs will be too much for many businesses and consumers, so the Fed cannot be gung-ho with its rate decisions.""
Traders have priced in a 76.9% chance that the Fed will hike interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%-5.50% in July and expect the central bank to hold rates through the end of 2023, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit more than one-year highs last week while the Dow scaled a six-month peak before hawkish comments from Powell sparked a selloff.
Still, an AI-inspired rally in technology and growth stocks as well as hopes that the Fed would soon end its rate-hike campaign put the main indexes on course for quarterly gains.
Markets are awaiting the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, initial jobless claims data and the final reading of first-quarter GDP later this week to assess the state of the U.S. economy.
Investors will also keep an eye on bank stocks, with the Fed scheduled to release 2023 results of its annual stress test of large banks after markets close on Wednesday.

In premarket trading on June 28, major U.S. chipmakers experienced significant declines following a report suggesting that lawmakers in Washington are contemplating imposing new restrictions on chip sales to China. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) witnessed drops of over 3%, while Nasdaq 100 Index futures declined by 0.5%. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday evening that discussions had taken place regarding potential limitations on the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China. Such measures could escalate tensions between the two countries. According to Bloomberg, China's technology sector is increasingly focused on competing with major US players like Google and Microsoft in the rapidly evolving global artificial intelligence (AI) race. Individuals ranging from billionaire entrepreneurs to mid-level engineers and veterans of foreign companies share a common ambition: surpassing China's geopolitical rival in the realm of AI, a technology that holds significant implications for global power dynamics. Notable figures include Wang Xiaochuan, an internet mogul who entered the field following the social media frenzy surrounding OpenAI's ChatGPT launch in November. These individuals join the ranks of Chinese scientists, programmers, and financiers, many of whom have backgrounds at companies like ByteDance, JD.com, and Google. It is estimated that China will spend approximately $15 billion on AI technology this year, fueled by this collective drive.
The U.S. Federal Reserve will announce the results of its annual bank stress tests on June 28. These tests assess the financial health of big banks by evaluating their balance sheets under hypothetical severe economic scenarios. The results determine the amount of capital required for the banks to remain healthy and the extent to which they can distribute capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Major U.S. banks are expected to demonstrate sufficient capital to withstand potential banking sector turbulence. The Fed established the stress tests after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to ensure banks can withstand similar shocks in the future. Initially, large banks struggled to pass the tests, and adjustments were made to address the Fed's concerns. Over time, banks have become more proficient in the tests, and the Fed has increased transparency. The pass-fail model was replaced with a more customized capital regime, reducing the drama surrounding the tests.
Oil prices experienced fluctuations, alternating between gains and losses, as investors assessed conflicting macroeconomic signals while also considering indications of potential weakness in the near-term market. Following a 2.4% decline in the previous session on June 27, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures initially dropped but later recovered to trade close to $68 per barrel. The market remained uncertain as investors evaluated various factors influencing oil prices, leading to a back-and-forth movement in the market.
European shares advanced on June 28, buoyed by strong economic data from the United States, which alleviated concerns about a significant economic slowdown. Investors were also anticipating remarks from central bankers at a forum later in the day for further insights into future policy decisions. The release of data on Tuesday, indicating increased new orders for vital U.S.-manufactured capital goods and improved consumer confidence, helped improve market sentiment, reported Reuters. Concerns over a potential global economic slowdown due to tightening monetary policies had weighed on investor sentiment in recent days. Market participants are particularly interested in a panel discussion involving central bankers, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. Their comments are expected to provide valuable guidance on future monetary policies.
On the U.S. stock market front, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Jason English have raised his recommendation on Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) from Neutral to Buy. At the same time, UBS analysts have upgraded Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) from Neutral to Buy. Meanwhile, notable stocks, including The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) and Guidewire Software, Inc.

The U.S. Department of Commerce could prohibit shipments of chips from Nvidia and others to customers in China as soon as early next month, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. Such an action would be part of final rules codifying and expanding export control measures announced in October, the Journal said, including:
Logic chips using so-called nonplanar transistors made with 16-nanometer technology or anything more advanced than that. Generally speaking, the smaller the nanometers, the more capable the chip.
18-nanometer dynamic random access memory chips.
NAND-style flash memory chips with 128 layers or more.
Nvidia, which produces graphics chips that drive the technology behind OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s Bard chatbots, responded to the government’s controls by making a version of its AI chips for the Chinese market called the A800 that initially fell below performance thresholds outlined by the Commerce Department. That chip replaced the A100, which is widely used in data centers to do AI computations. The new restrictions being contemplated by the department would ban the sale of even A800 chips without a license, the Journal reported.
Other countries are joining the US in banning certain chip technology to China. The Dutch government is planning to publish new export controls that will restrict the shipments of three models of ASML Holding NV’s machines from being sent to China as soon as this week, Bloomberg previously reported. Japan joined the US and Netherlands, limiting 23 types of chip exports to countries including China as early as July.

Under the Commerce Department proposal, expected in July, the US would revise export controls announced in October to make it harder to sell some chips to China without a license. The move is aimed in part at Nvidia Corp.’s A800 chip, which the US-based company designed after the earlier controls were announced and came just within their limits.
The Commerce Department and Nvidia declined to comment. Plans for the tighter controls were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
Some Chips Are Already Banned as Fear of More Curbs Hits Nvidia
The move highlights the Biden administration’s determination to contain China’s technological rise and could escalate tensions between the two countries.
Nvidia shares fell 0.7% to $415.74 in morning trading in New York on Wednesday, paring an earlier decline of as much as 2.9%.

It’s not clear whether the announcement will also include an extension of general licenses given to South Korean and Taiwanese companies. Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won a one-year reprieve from the restrictions last October and have asked the White House to extend them by at least another year.

(Reuters) - Apple's stock climbed to an intra-day record high on Wednesday, and was on the cusp of ending the session for the first time with a market capitalization above $3 trillion.
The iPhone maker's shares rose as much as 1% to $189.90, their highest ever. With the stock last trading off that session high, up 0.4% at $188.81, the iPhone maker's stock market value stood at $2.97 trillion, according to Refinitiv data.

Apple has jumped 46% in 2023, while Nvidia has surged 185%, making it the first chipmaker with a stock market value over $1 trillion. Tesla and Meta Platforms have more than doubled this year, and Microsoft has added 40%.
Apple's approach toward its $3 trillion milestone follows the June 5 launch of a pricey augmented-reality headset, its riskiest bet since the introduction of the iPhone more than a decade ago.
As well, Apple's most recent quarterly report in May showed a drop in revenue and profits, but still beat analysts' expectations. Along with a steady track record of stock buybacks, those financial results reinforced its reputation among investors as a safe investment at a time of global economic uncertainty.

NVDA,2023-06-28 17:41:34,"The hype around AI isn't a metaverse moment, BlackRock argues. It's the start of a market mega force.","The hype surrounding artificial intelligence has garnered comparisons to the metaverse hype of 2021.
Even AI's banner company, Nvidia (NVDA), was once the flag bearer for metaverse stocks. But at BlackRock’s 2023 Midyear Outlook Media Roundtable on Wednesday, BlackRock's CIO for Global Fundamental Equities Tony DeSpirito pointed out a key difference.
""The demand is really real,"" DeSpirito said. ""I think that contrasts what’s going on in AI versus the metaverse of a year ago or virtual reality. The orders are there…The earnings growth is just coming.""
To DeSpirito's point, Nvidia started the latest AI-led rally in stocks by attributing its revenue guidance boost to ""demand related to generative AI.""
But for BlackRock, the AI opportunity is not just about Nvidia and it's not just about semiconductors. BlackRock released its 2023 midyear outlook on Wednesday initiating an Overweight rating on AI as a ""mega force."" Other topics BlackRock labels as mega forces driving markets include geopolitical fragmentation, aging populations, and the low-carbon transition.
""We think the importance of data for AI and potential winners is underappreciated,"" BlackRock's investment team wrote in its midyear outlook. ""Companies with vast sets of proprietary data have the ability to more quickly and easily leverage a large amount of data to create innovative models. New AI tools could analyze and unlock the value of the data gold mine some companies may be sitting on.""
When asked by Tker's Sam Ro if the skyrocketing stock prices for some of the top AI plays should be a concern, BlackRock's investment team said it's best to be nimble.
""We’re not advocating getting into AI at this juncture because we already have exposure to these kinds of forces,"" BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li said. ""We’re just advocating staying invested because we think demand for semiconductor chips [is] very real. The growth in sales and revenues are very real.""
Li added that while megacap tech's exposure to AI helped most investors get involved in the AI rally to start 2023, investors should be making an ""explicit"" decision to include AI exposure in their portfolio moving forward.
There are several ways to play that theme too, according to DeSpirito. There will be companies that build new business models around AI. There will be others who merely must incorporate AI as an added cost to their business. Sifting through whether AI is boosting profits versus merely becoming another piece of the cost structure will be key in what DeSpirito believes is a ""stock-picking"" market.
Because, as DeSpirito points out, the AI story isn't any different than other investment themes. It's all about compounding profitability.
“The nice thing about high profitability is that time is on your side,"" DeSpirito said. ""The longer you hold the company, the more the profits accrue to shareholders over time.""

An update to those rules may come by late July, two sources said, but one cautioned that such U.S. actions involving China often get delayed.

The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the Biden administration was considering new restrictions on exporting AI chips to China.
One of the October rules limited the sale in China of chips that can provide the computing power needed to create artificial intelligence technologies similar to ChatGPT, a move that immediately impacted sales of products from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, and would likely affect future offerings from Intel Corp.
The possible rule tightening would hardest hit Nvidia, whose strong position in the AI chip market helped make it worth $1 trillion earlier this year.
""""We do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results,"" Nvidia's Kress said on Wednesday.
Questions have arisen about how effective the October rule will be in slowing Chinese companies' development of AI systems.
Nvidia has made special chips for the Chinese market that comply with the October restrictions, but Reuters reported last month that major Chinese companies such as Tencent Holdings plan to use Nvidia's export-compliant chips to cut the time it takes to train huge AI systems by more than half.
The current rule around AI chips involves two restrictions. One restriction focuses on how fast chips can communicate with each other, which is important because AI systems such as ChatGPT require thousands of chips to be chained together. The other restriction focuses on how much computing power the chip can have.
The H800 chip that Nvidia created for the Chinese market, for example, has as much computing power at some settings used in AI work as the company's chip for the rest of the world, but its chip-to-chip speeds are limited, according to a specification sheet seen by Reuters.
Intel declined to comment. AMD declined to comment. Previously, AMD have said the rules will not have an impact on its financial results.

Equity investors should turn away from the mega-cap Big Tech giants that have started the year on such a tear - and diversify their portfolios toward value stocks instead, according to one CEO.
A small handful of stocks – including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla – have been responsible for nearly all benchmark indices' gains in 2023, with the S&P 500 up 13% and the Nasdaq Composite jumping 27% year-to-date.

""Chasing anything rising at those type of growth rates is a problem,"" Conzo added. ""So where do you put money to work? You put money to work where it's not doing all that well – like value.""
Several strategists have expressed a similar viewpoint to Conzo on Tesla's stock, which has been surging non-stop for months, with banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley calling for investors to start selling some of their shares in order to take profits from the rally.

Value investors seek out stocks that they believe are underpriced, whereas growth investors look to snap up shares from companies in rapidly-expanding sectors like tech.
The first of those trading strategies beat the market in 2022, with tech and other growth stocks plummeting as the Federal Reserve ramped up its interest-rate hiking campaign.
But growth names have roared back this year, a combination of the expectation that the Fed will soon slash interest rates and a massive surge of interest in ChatGPT and artificial intelligence tech.","Ditch surging Big Tech stocks and pivot to value instead, The Wealth Alliance CEO says",418.76001,411.17001,408.22,6,2023,28
NVDA,2023-06-28 19:00:18,Possible new restrictions against the export of AI chips to China are seen as an escalation of tensions between Washington and Beijing.,"The possibility of new US restrictions on AI chip exports to China ""is now turning into almost a geopolitical economic warfare issue,"" says one Wall Street strategist.
Reports that the US Commerce Department could impose more export restrictions on the most advanced semiconductors with artificial intelligence capability would likely have implications for China’s economic growth and military advancements.
""It’s not only targeting future economic growth. But it’s also very, very military AI-specific, which is the new frontier,"" Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.
""Whenever we restrict economic sovereignty of a country, it becomes a pretty big red line [for China].""
Any new restrictions would be on top of ones that were announced last year on machinery to make the most advanced chip technologies, as well as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 circuits for very deep generative AI loads.
“Nobody knows how deep these [restrictions] are going to go,” said Mortonson. ""But I think it's very obvious it's now become an economic policy to not let China have our most advanced silicon technology.""
The semiconductor industry has been on fire this year amid hype over AI. Investors have been pouring money into names like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).
On Wednesday, both stocks were down slightly.
Mortonson said that China represents 25% to 30% of total revenue exposure for both companies. ""It's probably a headwind on core growth,"" said Mortonson.
It's unclear how China would react to new restrictions, but Mortonson says investors can expect retaliatory action from Beijing against US companies.
""China controls a lot of the supply of other products into the US. They're not going to sit back here. They'll strike back at the US in other ways,"" said the strategist.
""They'll go after some US companies that have very, very, big businesses,"" he added.

NVDA,2023-06-28 19:12:26,"Royal Caribbean and Carnival are rubbing shoulders with Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta as the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year.","Royal Caribbean and Carnival are among the five best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year.
The other three are tech titans: Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms.
The two cruise lines are seeing their businesses rebound strongly after the pandemic.
Two of the five best performers in the S&P 500 this year have nothing to do with artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, or any other revolutionary technologies. They ferry people around the world on cruise ships.
Royal Caribbean Cruises stock has surged 97% this year, trailing only Nvidia (187%) and Meta Platforms (139%) in the benchmark US stock index. Carnival Corporation, another cruise line, has soared 81%. Elon Musk's Tesla rounds out the S&P 500's biggest winners this year, with a 96% gain.
Royal Caribbean and Carnival have racked up those massive gains in 2023 for a few reasons. A key one is the pair have a lot of ground to make up; they were among the hardest-hit stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the cruise business ground to a halt once global travel restrictions were imposed.
Despite their robust gains this year, Carnival shares still trade about 70% below their pre-pandemic levels, while Royal Caribbean shares are down by around 25%.
The release of pent-up demand for travel has also revitalized the companies' operations, their latest earnings reports show.
For example, Royal Caribbean's revenue nearly tripled year-on-year to $2.9 billion in the first quarter as both ticket and onboard sales soared. As a result, the operator swung from a nearly $900 million operating loss to an almost $300 million profit, and more than doubled its full-year growth expectations to as high as 7.75%.
Meanwhile, Carnival's revenue jumped by about 230% to over $9 billion in the first six months of this year, fueling a $120 million operating profit — a sharp contrast to its $1.5 billion operating loss in the same period of 2022. The company raked in record second-quarter revenue, and passenger bookings for future trips hit an all-time high.
Royal Caribbean and Carnival are riding high on a tidal wave of demand, and their stock prices are still well below pre-pandemic levels.

MENLO PARK, California (Reuters) - Oracle Corp is spending ""billions"" of dollars on chips from Nvidia Corp as it expands a cloud computing service targeting a new wave of artificial intelligence (AI) companies, Oracle founder and Chairman Larry Ellison said on Wednesday.
Oracle's cloud division is working to gain ground against larger rivals such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp. To get an edge, Oracle has focused on building fast networks that can shuffle around the huge amount of data needed to create AI systems similar to ChatGPT.
Oracle is also buying huge numbers of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed to crunch that data for AI work.

Oracle said last month it had struck a deal with Cohere, an AI startup founded by ex-Google engineers, under which Cohere will offer its AI software running on supercomputers inside Oracle's data centers with as many as 16,000 Nvidia chips each.
Other companies such as CoreWeave, which earlier this year raised a fresh $200 million of funding, are also targeting AI companies with cloud hardware that relies heavily on Nvidia chips.

(Reuters) -Inflection AI, a startup backed by several Silicon Valley heavyweights, said on Thursday it had raised $1.3 billion in a fresh round of funding amid a boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.
The investment valued the Palo Alto, California-based company at $4 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The AI space has been hailed as the next frontier for technology after OpenAI's bot ChatGPT became a viral sensation late last year.
The industry has drawn several investors in the past few months as corporate executives examine ways to integrate the technology into their businesses, while regulators have been mulling how to tackle the technology.
Inflection's funding comes less than two months after the company, founded by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Google DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, released its chatbot, Pi.
Pi uses generative AI technology, similar to ChatGPT, to interact with users through dialogues, allowing people to ask questions and share feedback.
Microsoft, an existing investor and also rival OpenAI backer, participated in Inflection's latest fundraise.
Nvidia, which has stepped up its AI investments recently, Hoffman, Bill Gates and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt also participated in the latest round, Inflection said.

This comes hot on the heels of a series of lucrative investments in the AI industry, with tech giants Microsoft and Nvidia backing the deal alongside tech titans like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.
Notably, Nvidia has emerged as the sole new investor in the group.
Following the launch of their groundbreaking chatbot Pi, Inflection was swamped with offers, leading to this impressive funding round. ""There’s so much further to go after [Pi] validates the core thesis, which is that conversation is the new interface,"" Inflection AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman remarked in an interview with Forbes. The startup also recently unveiled its first proprietary language model, Inflection-1, which is said to be on par with GPT 3.5, Chinchilla, and PaLM-540B and was trained “using thousands of NVIDIA H100 GPUs on a very large dataset” according to a paper produced by the company.
Though Suleyman remained cryptic about the specifics of the funding, he assured that a ""very, very large chunk"" was in liquid dollars, but didn’t say exactly how much. The round didn't come with control-claiming conditions or restrictions, preserving Inflection's freedom to forge new commercial partnerships. Suleyman emphasized, ""There's no IP movement, and we still are entirely independent.""
Inflection plans to use this funding to enhance Pi, a chatbot designed to generate valuable questions and answers through interactive dialogue. While the company didn't share user metrics, Suleyman confirmed that Pi's engagement rates are soaring as it becomes more refined and better at what it does.
According to Suleyman, Pi is just the tip of the iceberg, signifying the future of interfaces through conversation. However, Suleyman anticipates more funding in the near future. This time though, venture capitalists need not apply. In his words, ""Our network and reach isn't something that regular VCs can help accelerate.""
Suleyman acknowledges that while the costs of training AI models are shrinking, their absolute spending is growing due to the need for larger models. Embracing this potentially historic growth opportunity, Inflection plans to ""blitz-scale"" and raise funding aggressively to fuel its rapid expansion.
These Three AI Startups Just Raised $2 Billion
In the wake of this investment, Inflection AI's GPU cluster, already one of the world's largest, is expected to undergo a massive expansion. The collaboration with Nvidia and service provider CoreWeave will see Inflection's new cluster swell to include 22,000 H100s, vastly outpacing Meta's 16,000 GPU cluster. AI training requires extremely powerful equipment, with a lot of RAM. Just as as comparison, an RTX 2060 (an average gaming GPU from 2019, still widely used today) has 6GB of vRAM, whereas an H100 boasts a whopping 80GB. Now imagine 22.000 of those chips working together.
AI has been the conversational topic among investors in 2023. AI stocks (for both hardware and software businesses) have been spiking throughout the year. Tech businesses are furiously integrating AI into their products and services to boost efficiency and investor appeal. Earlier this week, AI startups MosaicML, NoTraffic, and CalypsoAI also raised a combined $2 billion in recent rounds. This level of interest is unparalleled in the history of AI startups.
Considering the moment AI startups are living, one thing is abundantly clear: the appetite for AI is insatiable, with no signs of slowing down.","AI Chatbot Startup Rockets to $4 Billion Valuation With Microsoft, Nvidia Backing",411.17001,408.22,423.01999,6,2023,29

UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)
UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.
In the first quarter of 2023, the company's revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.
The stock has surged 36% year to date, but it hasn't always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.
Wood's Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,363,938 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $486.73 million, UiPath is the fifth-largest holding at Ark.

Twilio's cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.
In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.
In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence ""will be a material accelerant over time for Twilio's business.""
Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,771,968 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $304.50 million.
Teladoc Health Inc. (NYSE:TDOC)
Wood's flagship fund also owns $300.43 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.
The company's platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.
At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.
In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.
While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc's first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.
The stock, however, wasn't able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $25.80 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.
‘The Biggest Artificial Intelligence Play'
Wood's biggest bet in the AI arena is a company that isn't known for being an AI stock — Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).
""We talk about Tesla all the time, it actually is the biggest artificial intelligence play,"" she said.
The reason has to do with the electric car company's autonomous driving technology.
Tesla is ARKK's largest holding with an 11.59% weighting.
Wood expects autonomous taxi platforms to deliver $8 trillion to $10 trillion in revenue globally in 2030 ""from almost zero right now.""
And because of Tesla's capabilities on that front, the booming autonomous taxi market could take its share price to a whole new level.
""We believe that in five years, 2027, it will be a $2,000 stock if our research is correct,"" she said.
Considering that Tesla shares trade at around $257 right now, Wood's price target implies a potential upside of over 670%.
Investing in disruptive innovation can be very lucrative — but sometimes it can feel like a roller coaster. For instance, while Tesla shares have more than doubled year to date, they are still down over 30% from their peak in November 2021.
If you don't like that kind of uncertainty, you might want to look into slow-changing industries that provide considerable cash returns to investors — such as those catering to basic human needs like food and shelter. For those seeking to generate passive income without the volatility associated with publicly traded stocks, there are avenues to invest in these essential service businesses through the private market.

It wouldn’t be the first time the government tightens control over the sale of chips to China. Recall, last September, the Biden administration implemented regulations that prevented the semiconductor giant from exporting A100 and H100 chips to Chinese customers without obtaining a license. At the time, the company estimated the potential impact could reach approximately $400 million per quarter. Nvidia found a way round the issue by designing less advanced chips, the A800 and H800, that blunted the impact somewhat.
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore notes that since the $400 million comments were made, Nvidia’s overall data center business has “roughly doubled,” although he senses that over the period, China has underperformed overall growth. “So maximum impact would be $700-800 million, or below 10% of data center revenue,” he opined, although he believes the actual impact would “likely be smaller.”
It should also be remembered that since September, in the wake of the AI goldrush, global demand for AI has increased significantly and is “much further from being satiated by supply.” In fact, Moore cites conversations with US customers after the news broke, who said they were “excited to take any product that might get repurposed from China.”
In the long run, it is clear constraints on China are a “material limiter.” However, considering that the restrictions seem to be permanently set slightly below the level of the A100, this outcome was expected regardless, due to the “rapid performance increases” of Nvidia’s high-end products, which would remain inaccessible to Chinese clients.
“As a result,” the 5-star analyst summed up, “we would remain quite confident in near term results even in the face of these incremental challenges. Certainly the concern may weigh on the stock in the short term, but the overall tenor of demand remains sharply up and to the right, and we don’t see this as a major disruption.”
All told, then, Moore reiterated an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on NVDA shares to go alongside a $500 price target. This indicates a potential growth of ~22% for the stock in the coming year. (To watch Moore’s track record, click here)
Looking at the consensus breakdown, other analysts have also been impressed. Based on 29 Buys, 2 Holds and a single Sell, the word on the Street is that NVDA is a Strong Buy. At $467.35, the average price target implies ~14% upside potential from current levels. (See Nvidia stock forecast)

“There are boom-bust cycles. AI’s probably in a bubble but there’s some high-quality AI out there that’s worth owning,” the financier said on BNN Bloomberg Television in Toronto. Nvidia Corp. may be overvalued right now, he added, “but if you own it for the next 15 years, you’ll probably be OK.”
Nvidia shares have surged 179% this year as investors bet it will enjoy years of rapid growth as an essential player in the advance of artificial intelligence. The stock trades at 53 times analysts’ estimates of adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Patience is key, Scaramucci said, comparing it to early winners of the internet era. “I owned Amazon for the last 25 years. At any point over that trajectory, it’s been a terrible or wonderful investment. But when you step back, it’s actually been a wonderful investment.”
Bloomberg reported in January that SkyBridge lost 39% in its biggest fund in 2022 because of bad bets on crytocurrencies and now-bankrupt platform FTX. The firm imposed new limits on the number of withdrawals clients can make in a year.
“I tease my clients and say everybody’s a long-term investor until they have short-term losses,” Scaramucci said.

“There are boom-bust cycles. AI’s probably in a bubble but there’s some high-quality AI out there that’s worth owning,” the financier said on BNN Bloomberg Television in Toronto. Nvidia Corp. may be overvalued right now, he added, “but if you own it for the next 15 years, you’ll probably be OK.”
Nvidia shares have surged 179% this year as investors bet it will enjoy years of rapid growth as an essential player in the advance of artificial intelligence. The stock trades at 53 times analysts’ estimates of adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Patience is key, Scaramucci said, comparing it to early winners of the internet era. “I owned Amazon for the last 25 years. At any point over that trajectory, it’s been a terrible or wonderful investment. But when you step back, it’s actually been a wonderful investment.”
Bloomberg reported in January that SkyBridge lost 39% in its biggest fund in 2022 because of bad bets on crytocurrencies and now-bankrupt platform FTX. The firm imposed new limits on the number of withdrawals clients can make in a year.
“I tease my clients and say everybody’s a long-term investor until they have short-term losses,” Scaramucci said.

NVDA,2023-06-30 03:20:20,"Investors are looking for the next ""juicy"" trade in the AI-led tech rally, according to Vanda Research.","Retail investors are chasing the next tech rally with AI-related stocks like Micron, Vanda said.
""Sentiment remains buoyant as investors appear to be in the chase for the next best 'juicy' trade.""
Though retail investor flows fell slightly, stock purchases are above the daily average since SVB's collapse.
Retail investors are looking to chase the next tech rally and are pouring money into four AI stocks, according to data from Vanda Research.
Though retail investor inflows fell slightly from the previous week, stock purchases remain above the daily average following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in early March, the investment research firm said in a note on Thursday.
""What's more interesting, however, is that beneath the surface, sentiment remains buoyant as investors appear to be in the chase for the next best 'juicy' trade following the megacap-led AI rally,"" Vanda said.
The firm identified four stocks that were gaining traction among retail investors as they search for new winners in the AI space.
1. Micron (MU)
The semiconductor firm just beat its earnings and revenue targets, pulling in $3.75 billion in revenue over the previous quarter. Still, retail investors had taken interest in the stock even before it posted its financial results, Vanda said, thanks to speculation it could be another AI gamble.
The stock has lagged behind larger names like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, but retail net purchases for Micron were 18 times their daily average, even before the company released its latest earnings report, Vanda said.
2. Oracle (ORCL)
Oracle's stock is up 40% from the start of the year, with shares briefly hitting a new record after a stellar earnings report. Total revenue for the 2023 fiscal year hit $50 billion, up 18% from last year.
On Wednesday, the database company also announced new AI capabilities within several of its cloud products, leading more investors to jump in on the stock.
Retail net purchases of the stock were about 145 times the daily average before its latest earnings report.
3. Adobe (ADBE)
Adobe was another to benefit from upbeat earnings, with revenue notching a $4.82 billion record in the second quarter, up around 10% from the previous year.
The developer of digital-publishing software also recently unveiled its new platform, Adobe Firefly, a generative artificial intelligence platform for content creators.
Retail net purchases of the stock were about 18 times greater than the daily average prior to its latest earnings report, Vanda said. The stock is up 43% from levels at the start of the year.
4. Snowflake (SNOW)
The company recently expanded its partnership with Microsoft and launched a new partnership with Nvidia to implement AI into its data cloud services.
""Retail traders like it when one of their favorite stocks partners with an AI leader,"" Vanda said, adding they expected the stock to continue its momentum. ""The firm's partnership with NVDA and MSFT to integrate AI tools into their suite of services was welcome by retail traders who are jumping on the stock and increasingly buying OTM call options.""",These are the 4 AI stocks retail investors are pouring into as they chase the next tech rally,408.22,423.01999,424.13,6,2023,30

LONDON (Reuters) - The first six months of 2023 have been eventful for financial markets - from an artificial intelligence (AI) inspired tech stock surge, commodity market capitulations, cryptocurrency comebacks to the worst banking crash since Lehman Brothers.
Linking it all has been the relentless rise in interest rates, which was exactly what battered markets in 2022. But just that this time has been different due to an unshakeable view that the end of the cycle is near.
The result? A 12%, or $6 trillion, rally in value of world stocks although it has been ominously top heavy.
Thanks largely to ChatGPT, the AI boom has seen the 'Big Tech' giants enjoy a combined surge of 70%..
Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix have made 35%-50% gains.
Meta and Tesla have more than doubled, while AI's demand for semiconductor chips catapulted Nvidia 180% higher, briefly adding it to the elite club of U.S. companies with a $1 trillion market value.
""Basically, things looked so grim at the end of last year that it hasn't taken much to lift the markets,"" said Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset, Royal London Asset Management.
But on the tech surge, he said that ""it might well be a bubble"", with the firms now effectively needing to bank a 40% jump in earnings to justify their lofty valuations.
Japan's Nikkei share average has been another stellar performer this year, surging 16% in dollar terms, or 26% in yen terms, setting it up for its best year in a decade.
Gold has jumped 5%, benchmark government bonds are up 3%-6%, while the world's most financially damaged countries have done even better.
Bonds in El Salvador, which is now battling out of a default, have returned a whopping 58%. Sri Lankan bonds made a return of 34%, Zambia 24% and war-ravaged Ukraine, Pakistan and serial-defaulter Argentina have all made 19%, each.
""It has been remarkable"" said Abrdn emerging market portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. ""Roughly half of last year's losses have been made back this year and it has all been in the last couple of months.""
YEN AND YUAN
The dollar has been steadier overall although the fact that Japan hasn't raised interest rates yet and China's economy is still spluttering mean the yen and yuan are down 9% and nearly 5%, respectively.
Turkey's efforts to tackle its problems following Tayyip Erdogan's re-election haven't been made any easier by another 28% dive in the lira.
Egypt has devalued its currency more nearly 20%, Nigeria has cut naira by 40%, while at the other end of the table Colombian and Mexican pesos and Hungary's forint are up between 10% and 17%.
There have also been around a total of 90 interest rate hikes this year by central banks globally versus just 17 cuts. If last year's rate actions are also added, it comes to just over 470 hikes, compared to 1,202 cuts since the global financial crash in 2008.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has lifted rates by 500 basis points (bps) from near zero last year, the European Central Bank has hiked rates by 400 bps and many developing world economies have done far more. Even the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary settings may be approaching a crossroads.
And it has all caused a plenty of churn.
Two-year Treasury yields, which are highly sensitive to the Fed's moves, rose from 4% to 5% in February, only to dive back to 3.5% when Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-sized U.S. lender few had even heard of, collapsed and consequently led to the 167-year-old Swiss behemoth Credit Suisse requiring an emergency rescue by UBS.
Fast forward and that rate is now at 4.8%. Europe's rates are marching up again and the gap between two and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields - a traditional harbinger of recession - is almost as inverted as it was before the blow-ups.
A RATE MISTAKE
In the cryptomarkets, bitcoin has bounced back with a bang, soaring more than 80% in typically volatile fashion.
Interest from Wall Street giants including BlackRock are also fuelling gains, although U.S. regulators suing Binance and Coinbase exchanges exposed crypto's vulnerability to regulatory crackdowns.
Commodities, another crucial piece in the macro jigsaw, have been subdued.
A 51% drop in Europe's natural gas prices, oil slipping 13%, and sharp declines in wheat and corn have all fed hopes of lower global inflation.
And while the 'Goldilocks' view of inflation and rates topping out may have won in the first half of 2023, the bears are still swinging.
""Risk premia have to rise,"" said Milla Savova, a European equity strategist at BofA, which having been wrongfooted by the rally this year is now predicting a 15% drop in the STOXX 600 and a recession by the start of 2024.
She warned the sheer aggressiveness of the rate hike cycle was now tipping economies over the edge. ""We think that this will be seen as a policy mistake when we look back in the years to come.""

Economic data releases and earnings
Surprises for investors have come from a few places this year.
For starters, I would wager most people sitting on gains in Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet had never heard of generative AI back in December 2022. And if they did, no way did they anticipate the hype around the nascent technology and explosive stock price gains.
Yet here we stand with the top five stocks in the S&P 500 (think: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google) now accounting for about 22% of the overall index thanks to these big gains, the most concentrated the index has been since at least 1980, Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells me.
It's wild.
Another surprise was the banking crash several months ago.
Who in the world expected a wave of all-out bank busts. Credit Suisse owned by UBS? Crazy!
Where the surprises haven't come from is on the economic front, which is interesting in light of the Fed's aggressive rate hikes making their way through the housing, auto and consumer sectors.
The economy has chugged along — albeit at a slow pace — but hasn't shocked the markets.
But those lack of economic surprises could change soon as the Fed eyes potentially two more rate increases this year. Said surprises may start on the jobs front, argues veteran Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.
""We forecast a significant slowdown in monthly non-farm payroll growth this year that falls below the 90k replacement rate in 4Q23, and bottoms in January 2024 at 40k before gradually improving to 72k/month in 2024,"" Zentner said in a note this week that deserved a lot more attention than it got (hence, we are discussing it in these pages).
Zentner thinks we could get the first negative headline payrolls figure for this cycle in September.
If it were to happen, it would mark a big-time slowdown from the 300,000 average pace of job creation we have gotten year to date.
The markets will unlikely take a negative headline jobs number well, Zentner contends. Investor attention may quickly shift to renewed fears of a recession at the hands of an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve.
""On a negative payroll print this year, risk-off sentiment in financial markets may soar, especially as investors remain on recession watch despite the strengthening soft-landing story,"" Zentner says.
The Fed may not be so quick to act by cutting rates on a drop in jobs, warns Zentner.
Another thing investors won't want to hear.
Written off surprises for 2023? Don't.

The new funding brings the total raised by the company to $1.525 billion.
One of DeepMind’s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, had set up the one-year-old artificial intelligence startup.
CEO Suleyman hired from DeepMind, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft.
The startup launched a chatbot called Pi, adding to the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP), Financial Times reports.
With Nvidia joining its investment round, the startup, co-founded by LinkedIn creator Reid Hoffman, said it has access to 22,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, the most sought-after AI industry today, costing $40,000 apiece.
OpenAI reportedly sought $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation, a lead investor in the ChatGPT-maker.
Pi, Inflection’s chatbot, can have personal conversations with users directly via an app or through text, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ: META), WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.
At its May launch, Suleyman described the chatbot as having the persona of a sympathetic sounding board rather than trying to provide information. The product is meant purely for casual conversation, which makes it safer and easier to control, Suleyman said.
Suleyman founded Inflection after he quit Google in 2022.
Suleyman left DeepMind in 2019 following an independent investigation into bullying and harassment accusations against him.

Anthony Scaramucci thinks artificial intelligence stocks may be in an asset bubble - but says that shouldn't stop investors from owning some of them.
""AI, we're probably in a bubble. But then I would tell people, 'you probably should own some AI,'"" Scaramucci said in interview with BNN Bloomberg on Friday, adding that he owned Amazon stock through its ups and downs, but ultimately, it proved to be a ""wonderful investment.""
""There are boom-bust cycles. AI's probably in a bubble but there's some high-quality AI out there that's worth owning,"" the SkyBridge Capital founder said.
The AI industry has been turbo-charged this year by the smashing debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Investors have grown excited about what the technology can offer, and piled into the top AI-exposed stocks including Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon.
Scaramucci said Nvidia stock is worth owning even though it might be overvalued at present. ""But if you own it for the next 15 years, you'll probably be OK,"" he added, in a nod to long-term investment in AI.
The Santa Clara-based semiconductor company has ballooned in value this year thanks to the ongoing craze around AI, with its stock rallying 179% since the start of January. That's helped push the company's market valuation above $1 trillion.
Surging interest in AI has also propelled the US stock market into bull territory, with the S&P 500 rising 14.51% so far this year, and inflated the wealth of several top tech CEOs like Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

(Reuters) -Artificial intelligence chips from Advanced Micro Devices are about 80% as fast as those from Nvidia Corp, with a future path to matching their performance, according a Friday report by an AI software firm.
Nvidia dominates the market for the powerful chips that are used to create ChatGPT and other AI services that have swept through the technology industry in recent months. The popularity of those services has pushed Nvidia's value past $1 trillion and led to a shortage of its chips that the Nvidia says it is working to resolve.
But in the meantime, tech companies are looking for alternatives, with hopes that AMD will be a strong challenger. That prompted MosaicML, an AI startup acquired for $1.3 billion earlier this week, to conduct a test comparing between AI chips from AMD and Nvidia.
MosaicML evaluated the AMD MI250 and the Nvidia A100, both of which are one generation behind each company's flagship chips but are still in high demand.
MosaicML found AMD's chip could get 80% of the performance of Nvidia's chip, thanks largely to a new version of AMD software released late last year and a new version of open-source software backed by Meta Platforms called PyTorch that was released in March.
Hanlin Tang, chief technology officer of MosaicML, said that the company believes that further software updates from AMD that are in the works should help its MI250 chip match the performance of Nvidia's A100.
""For most (machine learning) chip companies out there, the software is the Achilles heel of it,"" Tang said, adding that AMD had not paid MosaicML to conduct its research. ""Where AMD has done really well is on the software side.""
Tang said that MosaicML used its tools, the PyTorch and AMD software to train a large language model without having to make any changes to its code base. If developers can find AMD's chips at the right price, ""you can already switch to these today they're essentially interchangeable"" with Nvidia chips, Tang said.
MosaicML sells software that makes it easier for companies to create AI systems inside their own data centers rather than paying for access to those systems from providers like ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The company said it conducted the research to illustrate that its customers have chip options beyond Nvidia.
""Mosaic’s results reinforce our strategy of supporting an open and easy to implement software ecosystem for AI training and inference on AMD hardware,"" AMD said in a statement, adding that it would continue to work with the company to tune its software.
Nvidia declined to comment.

Investors should pile into smaller-cap stocks with Big Tech looking overvalued, according to Robert Hoffman.
""There's tremendous value still existing within the S&P 500,"" he said.
The US economy won't slip into a recession this year – and that creates an opportunity for investors to ditch Big Tech and load up on mid- and small-cap stocks, according to a Citi Private Bank strategist.
Robert Hoffman said Friday that he's anticipating ""a strong rebound"" for companies with lower valuations, because he's believes the economy will either avoid a recession altogether or suffer a later-than-expected slowdown.
""What we were originally anticipating – a recession towards the end of 2023 – has now been pushed very far off, we're actually looking much closer to the end of 2024 now,"" Hoffman, the bank's head of investment counselors in South Asia, told CNBC International.
""We think the US mid-cap space offers very compelling valuations and an opportunity if you do avert a recession or should it get pushed further out,"" he added.
Hoffman's prediction that there won't be a recession this year comes despite many economists warning that a slump could be looming and US GDP growth slowing to just 1.1% last quarter.
A handful of large-cap tech stocks - including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla – have shaken off those gloomy circumstances to power the S&P 500 15% higher, with investors piling into the mega-cap names in a bid to take advantage of the explosion of interest in artificial intelligence.
But those stocks ""have gotten far ahead of themselves as far as current market valuations"" are concerned, Hoffman said – while maintaining that investors can still find returns in other, smaller S&P 500 names.
""I would say 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 have not outperformed the broad S&P benchmark this year – so there's tremendous value still existing within the S&P 500,"" he said.","Stop worrying about a recession - but it's still time to dump overvalued Big Tech stocks, Citi strategist says",408.22,423.01999,424.13,6,2023,30

The milestone comes after a rip-roaring first half of 2023 for tech stocks, which has seen the Nasdaq rise 30% while Apple stock has gained more than 45%.
Wall Street and Silicon Valley are all in on the generative AI hype wave that kicked off with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov. 2022. But while companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) can point to their work in AI for at least partially buoying their share prices, Apple has largely stayed away from any mention of AI.
Instead, the company's biggest achievements have come via its ability to navigate the supply chain crisis caused by COVID lockdowns in China and the resilience of its iPhone business—and the promise of diving into new the AR/VR headset market with its Vision Pro.

Apple, like other tech companies, faces difficult comparisons over the last few earnings seasons as it digested the massive pull forward in sales of iPhones, Mac computers, and iPads during the pandemic.
And while Mac and iPad revenue in the latest quarter was lower than in the same period of 2022, iPhone sales jumped year-over-year.
In June Apple debuted a 15-inch version of its popular MacBook Air, which could help boost Mac sales moving forward, especially as we enter the all-important back-to-school shopping season. But iPad sales could still be challenged moving forward.
The Cupertino-based company is also moving in a handful of new directions that could define its future. Its most ambitious Vision Pro headset is set to launch in early 2024 at an eye-watering $3,499.
But Apple is likely to bring that price down to a more palatable range to ensure the average iPhone owner can afford the headset. That could open up a whole new product category for the company, though reaching the highs of its iPhone business is a tough prospect.
Perhaps more importantly are Apple's moves into the Indian market.
The company opened its first store in the country in April, signaling its commitment to growing its market base in the world's most populous nation. But Apple's products are still prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of Indians, meaning sales growth will likely be slow.
Apple is also in the process of moving some of its manufacturing might into India, as it seeks to trim its reliance on China as its main hub for building iPhones and other products.
The effort comes as geopolitical tensions between the US and China put Apple in the difficult position of having to placate two rival countries while continuing to operate a successful business. Moving to India, and other regions of Asia could alleviate some of those problems.

Wall Street and Silicon Valley are all in on the generative AI hype wave that kicked off with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Nov. 2022. But while companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) can point to their work in AI for at least partially buoying their share prices, Apple has largely stayed away from any mention of AI.
Instead, the company's biggest achievements have come via its ability to navigate the supply chain crisis caused by COVID lockdowns in China and the resilience of its iPhone business—and the promise of diving into new the AR/VR headset market with its Vision Pro.
""This is ultimately a safe haven type of company for investors no matter the macroeconomy you're in,"" CFRA vice president and technology equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance Live ""It's a name we continue to live and a name we continue to tell investors, 'Don't necessarily trade, it's a name you want to be investing in for the long term.'""

NVDA,2023-06-30 21:40:16,"The AI-fueled rally is here to stay as it gets supercharged by strong second-quarter earnings, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.","A new tech bull market has arrived - and it's here to stay, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
He said a strong earnings season next month is set to put ""more fuel in the tank of this tech rally.""
US tech stocks have soared this year, thanks to investor excitement over the rise of artificial intelligence.
The artificial-intelligence craze has ignited a new bull market in tech stocks that'll set off a broader equities rally, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
""We believe a new tech bull market has begun to take shape being led by the AI Revolution; we expect to see a stronger 2Q earnings season for the tech space in the next month. We believe the stage is set for a tech earnings season put more fuel in the tank of this tech rally,"" Ives said in a tweet on Friday.
The Wedbush analyst has consistently projected a bullish outlook for US stocks, previously saying that a new AI-fueled rally will start elevating a broader group of tech stocks, beyond Big Tech names like Apple and Amazon.
""2q starts it the next month,"" Ives said in his most recent tweet, referring to the earnings season that will see companies release reports between mid-July and August.
Investor excitement over the rise of AI has defined markets this year, following the smashing release of human-like chatbot ChatGPT. It's helped boost the S&P 500 by about 14% this year, and seen investors pile into stocks best exposed to the fast-moving tech - such as semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia.
The Santa Clara-based firm has emerged as a clear winner from the AI boom, surging 179% so far this year to secure its spot in the elite club of companies with more than $1 trillion in market cap. Microsoft and Oracle are also among other tech companies that have seen huge gains this year.
Previously, Ives said the AI rush is the ""fourth industrial revolution"" that will see $1 trillion in investment over the coming decade.","A new tech bull market is here - and expect strong second-quarter earnings to add more fuel to the rally, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says",408.22,423.01999,424.13,6,2023,30
NVDA,2023-06-30 21:56:35,Apple on Friday became the first publicly-traded company to have a market value of $3 trillion or more at the close of Wall Street's trading day.,"Apple has become the first publicly-traded company to have a market value of $3 trillion or more at the close of Wall Street's trading day.
The iPhone and Mac computer company had been valued at $2.98 trillion when the market closed on Thursday, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Apple's stock price rose 2.21% on Friday to $193.78, driving the tech giant's market cap to $3.05 billion.
The ""historic"" achievement marks ""another milestone for a technology juggernaut that has reshaped society with a line-up of products that churn out eye-popping profits,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors Friday.
Apple, founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, passed the $3 trillion market cap milestone in January 2022, but the stock price subsequently fell 25% over the rest of the year to $130 before beginning the current climb.
While the $3 trillion market value achievement is largely symbolic, its magnitude is still breathtaking, The Associated Press noted, calculating that $3 trillion could buy nearly 9 million homes in the U.S., based on the average sales price during the past year as calculated by Zillow.
Overall, the stock market had a good day with the Nasdaq composite index, which includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and more than 3,000 other companies, up 1.45% and closing the first six months of 2023 up more than 31%, for its best first half since 1983, according to CNBC.
Apple, which along with Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia is in the S&P 500, have helped it rise 16% – its best first half since 2019, CNBC reported. The Dow has risen 3.8% for the year and was on track for its best month since November and its third winning quarter.
Tech's trillion-dollar club – Amazon, Microsoft and more – over the years
Back in September 2018, Amazon surpassed $1 trillion in market value to join Apple, which had passed that mark the month before.
By 2020, Alphabet and Microsoft had joined those companies in the $1 trillion club. But many tech companies – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft among them – lost billions during 2022.
Apple overcame supply chain issues and a tough economy to return to the $3 trillion market cap mark, Ives said. And the company could become even more valuable with its promised Vision Pro VR headset next year – and demand for new iPhones, some of which could be more durable with rumored titanium frames coming to some models.
Factor in apps for the VR headset and Apple's growing services revenue, in general, and Apple's ""fair valuation could be in the $3.5 trillion range with a bull case $4 trillion valuation by FY25,"" Ives said.
What are the most valuable public companies after Apple?
These are the world's ten largest companies based on market cap, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com:
Apple – $3.05 trillion
Microsoft – $2.53 trillion
Saudi Aramco – $2.08 trillion

That hefty weighting means moves in Apple’s shares have an outsized influence on index performance.","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The massive rally in Apple's shares is forcing some fund managers to revisit a thorny dilemma: they may not own enough of the stock.
Apple’s share price has soared 49% so far this year, ballooning its weight in stock indexes to record levels and pushing its market capitalization over $3 trillion. The company’s weighting in the S&P 500 has swelled to 7.6%, the biggest of any one stock in the history of the benchmark index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
That hefty weighting means moves in Apple’s shares have an outsized influence on index performance. Yet many investors hold allocations of Apple that are smaller than its relative weighting in indexes, whether it's due to the desire for portfolio flexibility, worries over owning too much of any one position and limitations imposed by the rules of their own funds.
If shares of Apple keep rallying, that could hurt the results of active fund managers, who strive to beat indexes such as the S&P 500 or Russell 1000.
The issue has taken on additional urgency this year, as the market’s gains are being led primarily by a handful of megacap companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, whose shares have outperformed.
“If you’re an active manager, one of the issues is it’s hard to own that much of one name. You are taking on more and more risk,"" said Todd Sohn, technical strategist at Strategas.
“Because they are such heavy weights within the benchmarks, it becomes really challenging to outperform.”
UNDERALLOCATED
Of 418 U.S. broad market funds tracked by Morningstar, only 26 held a greater weight in Apple than the stock's weight in the S&P 500, according to their most recent regulatory filings.
The lower allocations to Apple and other stock market winners may be hurting their performance. Only 20% of actively managed mutual funds with broad U.S. market exposure have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date as of June 28, according to Robby Greengold, strategist at Morningstar.
Only 6% of active large-growth funds around in 2013 outperformed the category benchmark through 2022, the firm’s data showed.
Greenwood Capital, which has $1.4 billion in assets under management, counts Apple as one of its top five holdings, said chief investment officer Walter Todd. But risk management rules at the South Carolina firm prohibit putting more than 5% into any one stock; that means the firm is underweight Apple compared to the S&P 500, to which Greenwood funds benchmark their performance.
The firm likes Apple's stock fundamentals, so ""it’s not that we are rooting for it to go down,"" Todd said. ""We just think there are other names that have the opportunity to do better.""
The cost of limiting Apple shares may be particularly high for fund managers this year, given the stock's swelling weight in indexes.
Apple's weighting in the S&P 500, for example, is bigger than the entire 37-stock consumer staples sector, which was last at a weight of 6.7%. In the MSCI All-Country index, a widely used benchmark for stocks globally, Apple's 4.7% weight is greater than that of all United Kingdom stocks combined, which account for 3.6%, according to DataTrek Research. Some investors are happy to hold hefty positions in the stock. Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments, said its F/m Investments Large Cap Focused Fund holds a 13% weight in Apple, slightly above the weight in the Russell 1000 growth index, which is the fund's benchmark.
“Fund managers at their own peril don’t hold Apple and a handful of stocks just like it at index weight or about index weight,” Morris said. Whether Apple can maintain its outperformance remains to be seen. Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio at 29.5 times, is about twice its median P/E over the past decade, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Analysts' median price target for Apple shares is $190, according to Refinitiv data, 2% below the stock's closing price of $193.97 on Friday.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, which has about $340 million under management, said his firm sold about one third of its shares this year over concerns about its valuation. The stock is still his firm's fourth-largest holding, even though at 4% of the portfolio, it puts it underweight Apple versus the S&P 500.
""If you don’t own any and the stock does well, indeed as it has this year, you run the risk of lagging,” Tuz said.

If you want to skip our industry analysis and introduction to the top players, head on over to 5 Best Machine Learning Stocks To Buy.
Machine learning is a technology that is right at the heart of 2023's technological revolution. Over the past couple of decades, we have seen several technological products such as semiconductors, personal computing devices, and the Internet revolutionize both business and public life. Now, it's time for machine learning to shine since it is one of the applications of artificial intelligence - the hottest technology these days.
Artificial intelligence has also played a crucial role in the stock market this year. The current rally in artificial intelligence started when ChatGPT made waves on the internet and impressed users with its ability to generate life like responses. This injected fresh optimism into the shares of firms that are directly linked to Open AI. These include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are responsible for powering Chat GPT and training the artificial intelligence platform. And these products are made by TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.
As a whole, the largest shareholders of AI related firms have profited quite a bit from artificial intelligence stocks. These have cumulatively led to billionaires such as Larry Ellison of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) adding $150 billion to their wealth. NVIDIA's shares are up by a whopping 195% year to date and the firm is the only semiconductor company that is currently worth more than a trillion dollars on the stock market. Meta, which faced a bloodbath on the stock market last year after its chief Mark Zuckerberg plowed billions of dollars into the metaverse, also saw some much needed love. Its shares are up by 130% year to date, lending it a market value of $735 billion.
The investor attention on machine learning is not without reason either, especially when we consider the market value and growth rates of the industry. For instance, a report from Fortune Business Insights outlines that the market is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.8% between 2022 and 2029 to grow from an initial $21 billion at 2023 end to $210 billion by the end of the forecast period. Similarly, a report from Market Research Future also has a 38.8% CAGR for a value of $106 billion by 2030.
So what are the top players in the machine learning market doing these days? Well, NVIDIA made a big but silent move in February this year when it acquired the machine learning startup OmniML. OmniML is a software company that develops software to speed up the machine learning process. Machine learning requires programmers and others to train models before the models are able to generate insights. OmniML automates this entire process to streamline the development process and enable quicker deployment of machine learning models. NVIDIA also has its own resources that enable developers to leverage and use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. It partnered up with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in May 2023 to use the latter's Azure machine learning platform for providing products and services to users for rapidly deploying these networks.
Another key player in the machine learning industry is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet has massive computing resources at its disposal, allowing it to develop numerous models for countless different use cases such as search engine queries. Another use case that is seeing attention from Google is money laundering. Announced in June 2023, the new platform uses machine learning to create a customer risk score to lower costs, improve risk detection, and provide a better customer experience. The anti money laundering platform has also been employed by HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) and Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD), with the former reporting as much as a fourfold increase in recognizing suspicious activity and a 60% reduction in alert volumes.
Yet, as big as Google is, anti money laundering is just one of the ways in which it is utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence. During the firm's first quarter of 2023 earnings call, its chief Mr. Sundar Pichai shared:
With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best machine learning stocks that are being favored by hedge funds. Som top machine learning stock picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

Since the start of 2023, the stock market has witnessed a significant shift in direction, marked by a noteworthy recovery in major indices. Most Wall Street investors believe that stocks have entered a new phase of a bull market, characterized by rising prices and positive market sentiment. Additionally, they express confidence that the U.S. economy will manage to avoid a recession in 2023, according to a survey conducted by CNBC Delivering Alpha in the last week of June.
The major stock exchanges concluded the first half of the year on a highly positive note, with the tech-heavy NASDAQ emerging as the frontrunner among them. The index returned 32.7% year-to-date, which marked its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. In addition to this, the combined value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by nearly $5 trillion this year so far, as reported by Fortune. One of the main reasons for this rally is a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI chatbots. Fortune reported that the surge in AI-related investments is being compared to the dot-com bubble of 2000 when the market got influenced by a limited number of tech stocks before experiencing a crash. The market's strong interest in generative AI has overshadowed major concerns that could have negatively impacted sentiment this year. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are reporting strong gains this year, after declining massively in 2022.
Historical data indicates that the second half of the year tends to be favorable for NASDAQ due to heightened economic activity. This period often sees increased consumer spending, business expansion, and overall economic growth, which can positively impact the performance of companies listed on the NASDAQ. According to a report by Forbes, from July 1 to December 31, NASDAQ has historically gained an average of 7.8%, compared to an average increase of 3.2% during the first six months of the year.

Analysts also believe that the tech rally will continue for the foreseeable future and is not expected to end anytime soon. This suggests that there is ongoing optimism surrounding the performance and potential of technology companies. Bryn Talkington, a managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, spoke about tech stocks this year in his interview with CNBC’s “Closing Bell”. He said:
Similarly, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, also presented a bullish outlook for the tech sector in the second half of the year. In his interview with Bloomberg, he stated:

That's the index's best start to a year in four decades, according to the Financial Times.
Investors have piled into Big Tech stocks over the past six months, inspired by the explosion of interest in AI.
Artificial intelligence just helped technology stocks to their best start to a year since 1983.
The Nasdaq Composite, which tracks the share price of over 2,500 companies and is heavily weighted toward tech, rose 32% over the first six months of 2023 – which was its best first half in four decades, according to Bloomberg data cited by the Financial Times.
The stock-market index also recorded its biggest jump for any half-year period since the dot-com boom helped it soar 73% in the second half of 1999, per Dow Jones.
AI has powered much of the Nasdaq's surge over the past six months, with investors piling into related stocks ever since interest in ChatGPT exploded at the start of the year.
Chipmaker Nvidia, electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla, and social-media giant Meta Platforms have emerged as three of the main winners of the AI craze.
Each racked up triple-digit gains in the first half of 2023 to solidify their status as members of a high-flying group of tech stocks that some have dubbed ""The Magnificent Seven"", alongside Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Amazon.
But some analysts believe that the Nasdaq's sensational early-2023 run won't last over the second half of the year, warning investors to take some profits now ahead of a potential correction in AI stock valuations.
""We don't believe the AI trend is a bubble but advise investors to be selective on AI-related stocks after the strong year-to-date rally,"" UBS Global Wealth Management equity strategist Sundeep Gantori said in a recent research note.
Tech stocks have also benefited from the Federal Reserve easing up on its monetary-tightening campaign over the first half of 2023 – because when interest rates stop rising, returns from investment avenues such as savings accounts tend to plateau, prompting investors look at other options such as stocks.

To skip our detailed analysis of the developments taking place within the AI sector, you can go directly to read about the 5 Stocks Jumping On The Generative AI Wagon.
The markets have been overwhelmingly influenced by artificial intelligence (AI) and, within it, generative AI this year. Every company is entering the AI race in fear of being left behind in the face of rapid technological changes and advancements, while those companies who were already part of the AI sector have been enjoying quite a boost in light of their head start on others. With AI becoming such an integral part of the economy today, it is unsurprising to see how companies are trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.
Recent AI Deals and Programs
As noted on CNBC's TechCheck on June 27 recent partnership between Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was announced this June, which highlighted the former's intentions to try and benefit from the latter's growing influence within the AI space. The partnership aims to make advanced AI capabilities available to enterprises. By combining Snowflake Inc.'s (NYSE:SNOW) ability to manage massive amounts of data with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU-accelerated computing and NeMo platform, which develops large language models (LLMs), the partnership will help businesses use their data to make custom LLMs for generative AI services. These include AI chatbots like ChatGPT and search and summarization services as well.
Another AI deal in the spotlight today is Thomson Reuters Corporation's (NYSE:TRI) $650 million acquisition of Castext, a company that develops AI-powered legal workflows. Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is aiming to make generative AI solutions available to its customers through this deal. Another AI deal that has become the talk of the markets is the Databricks acquisition of MosaicML for $1.3 billion. Through MosaicML, you can train and deploy LLMs and other generative AI models in your data in a secure environment. MosaicML has been considered a rival to OpenAI, meaning that with this acquisition, Databricks has also joined the generative AI race.
""Pioneers Need To Be Willing To Be Misunderstood For Long Periods Of Time""
CNBC showed on June 22 that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also announced a $100 million program through which it hopes to help its customers use generative AI. The markets have been viewing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a lagger in the generative AI space so far, so this move may seem to some as a way to rectify this image. The company may be attempting to mark its own territory within this space by signaling to other big tech competitors that it is now working to bring generative AI tools and models to its cloud customers through Amazon Web Services. Here are some comments on this move from Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services:
Selipsky also mentioned in his CNBC interview that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now also working on developing its own ""machine learning, AI-specific chips"" alongside several other projects within the AI space. It was noted that other companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been receiving more recognition on Wall Street for their AI contributions, particularly in generative AI, to which Selipsky responded that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a saying which goes ""pioneers have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."" He elaborated on this by saying that the company has many past examples which show that it was more focused on its customers and building what they want, adding that if that led to misconceptions about the company's trajectory, that was alright, as long as its customers understood where it was going. In light of this, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) move to make generative AI available to its customers now may begin to make more sense to Wall Street as this shows how the company is once again trying its best to meet customer needs.
The above-mentioned deals, acquisitions, and programs highlight how many companies are trying to enter the generative AI race by partnering with other companies using generative AI. We have elaborated on more of these companies below in our list to show which generative AI stocks the markets should be watching today.

The launch of new Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones and strong demand for AI chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD), with robust wafer-start momentum is likely to trigger the rebound, Digitimes reports.
Companies like TSMC had a challenging start during 2023 due to supply chain disruptions, weak demand further intensified by U.S. sanctions on Chinese industries, and the Russian-Ukraine conflict.
However, launching OpenAI and companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and Amazon.Com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) entering the AI race helped the sector redeem its losses.
Reportedly, Nvidia had placed additional orders at TSMC for chips. The chipmaker expects Q2 revenue of $11 billion thanks to the AI boom.
Nvidia stock has surged close to 200% YTD.
The AI hype also drove orders for Broadcom's AI-related customized chips (ASIC). Google and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) have placed orders with Broadcom.
Nvidia is working on advanced versions of its current H100 GPUs after hitting the trillion-dollar club with its lineup of the A100 & H100 GPUs.

While even bears know to get out of the way of a stock market on the run, the amazing performance some stocks have put in through the first half of 2023 has been nothing short of astonishing. In fact, a number of factors are flashing warning signs for more conservative investors, who worry that the market as a whole — and some individual stocks in particular — have gone too far, too fast.

While momentum players and “fast-money” traders love a market that only seems to go straight up, risk-averse investors are getting wary of the new bull market. Here’s why.
Many Stocks Have Already Posted Triple-Digit Returns in 2023
We’re only at the midpoint of 2023 and a number of stocks have already posted returns in excess of 100% year-to-date. Some analysts view this as the sign of a frothy market, as no stock can sustain a 100%-plus move without giving some back at some point. In fact, many of the market leaders in 2023 were absolutely decimated in 2022, and some analysts worry that this could happen again.
Nvidia, for example, is already up nearly 190% YTD in 2023, but that’s on the back of a more than 50% loss in 2022. Meta Platforms, and a host of other tech winners in 2023, all dropped by roughly 50% or more in 2022 as well. While these stocks may not give back all of their gains, now is not the time that many risk-averse investors are looking to pick up shares in these big winners.
Take a Look: 10 Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon
Market Breadth Is Narrow
Market breadth refers to the number of stocks that are leading the way in terms of a market rally as opposed to those that are falling. Although market breadth has widened in recent weeks, it still remains quite narrow. Tech stocks in particular have led the way, with names like Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft carrying the market on its back. In fact, as of June 1, just seven stocks — Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet — have provided more than 100% of the S&P 500’s YTD gains, meaning that index would actually be negative without those market leaders.
Without a broadening of stocks participating in the rally, it might not have much longer to run. If profit-taking were to hit some of the market leaders — which would not be surprising given their huge runs over the past few months — the market as a whole could suffer tremendously.
The Fed Remains Hawkish
The Fed has aggressively raised interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to help combat 40-year highs in inflation. While inflation has indeed fallen significantly to start the year, the CPI still remained at 4% as of May 2023, exactly double the Fed’s stated target rate. Although interest rates are also very high on a relative basis, the Fed has indicated that there’s likely still more work to be done, meaning that rates are likely to go even higher still. This would affect both the cost of doing business and the amount of interest that consumers pay on everything from credit cards and auto loans to home mortgages.
The fact remains that the combination of high interest rates and high inflation may dampen spending and consumer demand, factors that would potentially translate into depressed corporate earnings — which in turn typically drag down stock prices.
The Yield Curve Is Still Inverted
If you watch the financial news, you’ve likely heard the phrase “the yield curve is inverted” quite frequently. Many analysts and economists view an inverted yield curve as a sign of an oncoming recession. But what exactly does it mean?
In simple terms, an inverted yield curve occurs when long-term bonds pay less than short-term bonds. Specifically, the difference in yield between the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond and the two-year U.S. Treasury bond is the most commonly used indicator. As of June 16, 2023, the two-year Treasury bond paid a full percentage point more than the 10-year, marking a decidedly inverted yield curve. This suggests that a recession is potentially looming, which typically coincides with a market correction or even a full-blown bear market.

In a move that a top Chinese trade adviser warned was ""just a start,"" Beijing said on Monday it would limit exports of products made from the minor metals of gallium and germanium to protect national security. That followed the U.S. decision to impose export restrictions to curb China's access to key technologies used for artificial intelligence.
Taiwan is a major producer of chips used in everything from smartphones and cars to fighter jets, supplying companies like Apple and Nvidia.
""After evaluation, we do not expect the export restrictions on raw materials gallium and germanium will have any direct impact on TSMC's production,"" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co said in an emailed statement.
""We will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" it added, without elaborating.
TSMC's Taipei-listed shares extended losses on Thursday, falling more than 2%, compared with a 1.5% drop on the broader market, in part due to worries about worsening China-U.S. trade tensions and ahead of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's visit to Beijing this week.
""If the talks between the two sides go well, many restrictions could be loosened, but if the talks go badly, both sides may put up more sanctions after Yellen goes home,"" said Capital Securities Corp analyst Liao Chien-yu.
Taiwan's WIN Semiconductors, which uses gallium for optoelectronic devices, told Reuters only a ""small number"" of substrates are purchased from China, with most of its supplies coming from Germany and Japan.
China's restrictions will have a very limited impact on the company's short-term procurement and wafer production and delivery, WIN added.
Another Taiwanese firm, Visual Photonics Epitaxy, told Reuters it also had multiple substrate suppliers, one of which is U.S. semiconductor wafer maker AXT, which said on Monday it would seek permits to keep exporting gallium and germanium substrate products from China.
Visual Photonics Epitaxy said it had noticed little effect so far from China's export restrictions. Its shares were down more than 4% on Thursday.

Economic data releases and earnings
The U.S. 10-Year Treasury Note yield (^TNX) jumped 9 basis points Wednesday to settle at 3.945% — the highest level since just before the mini-bank panic in March.
This essentially confirms the message from the Federal Reserve today in its minutes from the June FOMC meeting — that ""almost all"" Fed members expect more rate hikes this year despite the pause last month.
""Higher for longer"" is indeed the 2023 mantra on Wall Street — just don't tell that to stocks, which are pricing in the softest of landings.
Meanwhile, the tech sector took a small hit in line with historical correlations (as tech stocks tend to prefer lower rates). However, some AI-hyped names like Microsoft (MSFT) were spared the red, while Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) managed an impressive 1.7% return. (Nvidia closed down, but its loss was limited to a measly 23 basis points.)
Bubble economics appear to trump real world factors when it comes to stocks. And the technicals suggest the bullish moves aren't over.
In fact, tech stocks this year have largely ignored persistently-high longer-term rates, decoupling from last year's tight correlation when the direction was down.
Even a mini-bank panic couldn't derail the growth names that have benefitted from AI press. Arguably, the Fed's liquidity provisioning to shore up the banking sector is now helping to fuel the broad-based bullishness, which is no longer confined to a few megacap and AI-themed stocks.
Looking at the real economy, the disparities persist. It's no secret that manufacturing is in a global slump, but consumers around the world are shoring up economies by spending on services.
This helps explain why the S&P 500 is up 16% this year while the industrial metal, copper, is down 13% from its January peak. Sectors matter; Copper cares about another Tesla factory much more than mom and pop taking a cruise around the Caribbean.
Time tends to correct most imbalances and irrationality in the markets, but Lord Keynes taught us (maybe) that the markets can remain irrational far longer than most investors can remain solvent.
Eventually, the manufacturing and services sectors will align again. The trouble is we don't yet know when —or even the direction.

This is particularly true when it comes to the AI-related stocks that have dominated the market thus far in 2023. While the time to buy names like Nvidia and Meta Platforms was clearly “yesterday” — as those stocks are up 190% and 145% thus far in 2023, respectively — the next-best time may not be today.
So, how is an investor to approach AI stocks in general as the rest of 2023 unfolds? Here’s a look at some potential answers.
Be Cautious With Big Winners — But Don’t Necessarily Avoid Them
It may not be the best idea to put all your money into Nvidia right now, as the stock has nearly tripled in just half of a year. But this doesn’t necessarily mean you should completely avoid it.
Although there is no doubt a bit of a speculative fervor in the stock, the reason for its rapid runup is sound. The semiconductor company is the leading creator of the processors that power countless artificial intelligence applications, making it the poster child for the future success of AI.
If AI is indeed going to dominate our world in short order, Nvidia is best positioned to benefit the most — hence all the enthusiasm. If you’re a believer in AI, Nvidia is a great way to play it.

Think Long-Term
If AI is really to become a world-changing investment trend, it’s going to last for the long term. What this means is that even when the current frenzy driving AI stocks subsides, there will still be plenty of opportunities to invest in the sector for the long run.
If you’re bullish on the sector for the long term, one investment strategy would be to dip your toe in now, in case the current run continues. Then, you can add to your positions if the AI sector falls prey to profit-taking, which is inevitable at some point.
Ask Yourself: Are Nvidia and Meta Platforms in a Bubble?
While it’s easy to say that stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms have reached bubble status during their stratospheric runs in 2023, that’s not necessarily true. For perspective, it helps to remember that these two stocks in particular got absolutely clobbered in 2022, falling 50.31% and 64.22%, respectively.
In other words, the first 100% or so of Nvidia’s 2023 gain just brought it back to where it was at the start of 2022. Meta Platforms is actually still below its price at the start of 2022. That stock will still have to gain another 33% to reach the all-time high it set in 2021. For investors that are still carrying big losses in Meta Platforms, it certainly doesn’t feel like the stock is in a bubble.
Watch Out for Signs of a True Bubble
Some analysts are quick to point out that while big, well-known tech names are running straight up in 2023, plenty of other stocks are lagging behind. One of the hallmark signs of a true bubble is when even previously unknown companies — often without any earnings or notable products — enjoy skyrocketing stock prices, mimicking and even outperforming the big-name market leaders.
If Wall Street starts creating lots of AI-related products, like ETFs, and small-name companies rocket to stratospheric highs on little-to-no real news, those could be signs of an AI bubble.
As reported by CNN’s “Before the Bell” news program, Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, said, “I don’t think from a stock perspective we’ve reached a full scale bubble.”
Suggestion: Invest in Companies, Not Concepts
One of the biggest ways to get yourself into trouble when it comes to investing is to put your money behind companies that are just concepts, rather than actual businesses. Plenty of entrepreneurial young companies have big dreams of how they’re going to change the world, but no company can survive over the long run without actual revenues and profits.
If you’re looking to invest in AI companies, there’s still plenty of time to pick those with long-term viability. Companies that simply change their name to include the letters “AI” might get a quick bump in the stock market but are just as likely to get completely wiped out over the long run.

NVDA,2023-07-06 19:52:15,"Though we've seen a number of high-profile investments in AI companies, the slowdown in VC funding has proven sticky, leaving many startups out in the cold, according to recent Crunchbase data.","A new Meta (META)? A new Nvidia (NVDA)? You may have to wait awhile.
Though we've seen a number of high-profile investments in AI companies, the slowdown in VC funding has proven sticky, leaving many potential startups out in the cold, according to recent Crunchbase data.
In the second quarter of 2023, global VC funding fell 49% from the prior year, falling $65 billion in the second quarter from $127 billion in the same period last year. This also marked an 18% drop from the first quarter of the year.
For the first half of 2023, funding fell 51% to $144 billion from $293 billion a year ago.
VCs and startups have run headfirst into a high-interest environment that may be here to stay, while also grappling with a tech industry that has faced a reckoning after hiring rapidly during the pandemic boom.
""We anticipate that funding will continue to slow, but not by such a high proportion,"" said Crunchbase senior data editor Gené Teare. ""The steepest drop has been for late-stage funding, which will take longer to recover since large late-stage private companies generally were valued at multiples much too high compared to values for high-growth public tech companies.""
An AI boom pushed tech stocks higher in the first half of the year, and for venture-backed companies this pocket of the market proved to be the primary bright spot.
The AI boom made way for new unicorns, including AI company Runway, which in late June announced a Series C extension with buy-in from Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), NVIDIA, Salesforce, and other investors amounting to $141 million.
Additionally, Databricks recently acquired MosaicML, a challenger to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, for a staggering $1.3 billion.
The end of the line?
Many startups are caught between a rock and a hard place. This past quarter, 6,000 startups successfully raised money, a sharp decline from more than 9,500 the same time last year.
""As investors are more selective in this funding climate, many of those startups will find it challenging to raise needed funding and as a result could shutter,"" said Teare. ""We’ve also seen other indications that more startups’ cash reserves are dwindling: In Crunchbase’s most recent quarterly startup survey, nearly one third of respondents who answered the question indicated that their startups have less than 6 months of runway left.""
Most of tech's biggest names began as startups, from Uber (UBER) to Alphabet, and conventional wisdom says that a downturn is a good time to build a company.
But that doesn't mean it's an easy moment to start a new company. And if struggles for startups continue we could see ripple effects across tech over time.
""Startups allow for thousands of experiments to be run, independent of how things were done before,"" added Teare.
""That creates new markets and new opportunities. Since the beginning of 2022, close to $600 billion has been invested in startups across all stages. Large returns delivered by a small percentage helps power the entire sector. That's why we follow them (and the money) so closely.""

NASDAQ is commonly associated with technology and growth-oriented companies that usually don't pay dividends but there are many dividend-paying stocks listed on the exchange as well. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.
The average dividend yield for stocks in the NASDAQ 100 is currently 1.03%, which is lower than the average dividend yield of 1.6% for companies in the S&P 500. One of the main reasons for NASDAQ’s low dividend yield is that the index primarily consists of companies in the technology and growth sectors, which tend to reinvest their earnings back into the business for research and development, expansion, or acquisitions. These companies often prioritize growth and innovation over distributing dividends to shareholders. As a result, they may have lower dividend payout ratios, resulting in a lower dividend yield for the index as a whole. On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average includes companies from various sectors, including more traditional sectors such as industrials, consumer goods, and utilities that tend to have higher dividend-paying stocks.

Since the start of 2023, there has been a resurgence of interest in growth tech stocks within the market. These stocks, which had faced significant challenges in the previous year, are now experiencing renewed attention and investor enthusiasm. NASDAQ is up 31.69% year-to-date, which represents its biggest increase during the first half of the year since 1983 when it rose by 37%. Moreover, the total value of companies in the Nasdaq 100 has surged by almost $5 trillion so far this year, as we reported in our article 12 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks to Buy. According to a report by Fortune, the Nasdaq had its best performance since the dotcom bubble peak in late 1999, for either the first or second half of any year. The increased investor interest indicates that technology stocks are expected to continue experiencing growth in the second half of the year.
Tony DeSpirito, BlackRock's CIO for fundamental equities, spoke with Fortune and expressed that the current enthusiasm surrounding AI is more authentic, which has mainly contributed to the growth of the tech sector this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:
Dividend-paying stocks, including those on Nasdaq, are often associated with more established companies that have a track record of generating stable earnings and cash flows. This stability can make dividend stocks less volatile than growth stocks, which may attract investors seeking more predictable returns. In this article, we have compiled a list of some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ.

NVDA,2023-07-07 19:17:19,"Leon Cooperman called out Nvidia's sky-high valuation, and predicted the S&P 500 wouldn't surpass its January 2022 high for several years.","Leon Cooperman warned the enormous hype around Nvidia and other growth stocks is dangerous.
The billionaire investor predicted the S&P 500 wouldn't reach a new high for several years.
Pressure on consumers and the Fed hiking interest rates could spark a recession in 2024, he said.
Leon Cooperman has called out the speculative mania around Nvidia and other popular stocks, and warned the US economy could slump into recession next year.
""We know that Nvidia's not going to end well,"" the billionaire investor said during an interview at The Ben Graham 10th Annual Conference on June 20.
Nvidia's shares have nearly tripled in price this year, boosting its market capitalization to a record $1 trillion, as investors wager the microchip maker will be a big winner from the artificial-intelligence boom.
""I've learned over the years that everything ultimately turns to shit, and the fall from 200 times earnings is a lot harder than the fall from eight or nine times earnings,"" Cooperman said, referring to Nvidia's current valuation. He noted that former stock-market darlings like Cisco have never reclaimed the breathless highs they reached during the dot-com bubble.
The Omega Advisors founder, and former head of Goldman Sachs' asset-management division, bemoaned the general state of madness that investors are in today.
""There's a lot of crazy things going on in the market,"" he said. ""I've never seen moves on such insignificant news as we're seeing in the market today,"" he continued, partly blaming the volatility on quantitative traders who ""know everything about price, know nothing about value.""
Cooperman attributed the rally in stocks this year — the S&P 500 has climbed 15%, while the Nasdaq 100 has surged 38% — to a major upswing in positive sentiment, not fundamentals such as larger corporate profits.
He cautioned the enthusiasm wouldn't last, and predicted the S&P 500 wouldn't surpass its January 2022 high of about 4,800 points for several years. However, he noted there are still plenty of undervalued stocks on the market today, paving the way for bargain hunters to score outsized returns.
Cooperman also touched on the US economic outlook, suggesting a recession could strike in 2024.
""If we have one it may come next year, when people run out of money and the Fed keeps raising rates,"" he said.
The veteran investor added that he's behaving cautiously against a backdrop of overpriced assets, lingering inflation, rising interest rates, and a looming economic downturn.
""I'm sufficiently nervous about the big picture that I'm not fully invested, I have cash,"" he said. ""But I would say that there's no shortage of good values around.""",Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman sounds the alarm on Nvidia stock - and warns a recession may hit next year,421.03,425.03,421.79999,7,2023,7

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The letter discussed the investment manager’s views on market crashes and according to him, each generation fails to learn from past lessons and financial markets are not immune […]","""The AI 'bell cow' leading the new investment narrative is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), currently priced at a level where its free cash flow yields only 0.45% for its shareowners; by comparison, riskless U.S. Treasury Bills now yield 5.3%. Unfortunately, 70% of Nvidia's meager cash yield of 0.45% is further eroded by stock-based compensation (SBC) for its employees and management. The company's stock compensation plan consumes $2.8 billion of the company's $28 billion annual revenue but shares outstanding have not decreased. Nvidia's market capitalization is 37% greater than Berkshire Hathaway. However, when comparing fundamentals, Berkshire Hathaway generated $23 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters while Nvidia generated only $2.6 billion (SBC adjusted). Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway does not dilute shareholders with stock-based compensation. Despite a wide array of available investment options, market participants have overwhelmingly favored a select few dominant technology companies.
At its current price of $423, Nvidia is valued at forty times its annual revenue. If one heroically assumes that the company manages to compound revenue by 50% per year for three years, it will ""only"" trade at a multiple of twelve times hypothetical sales in 2026...hardly a screaming bargain. Of course, market history has an interesting way of repeating itself. The most exaggerated technology bubble occurred in 1928-29 when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) captured the imagination of every speculator on Wall Street. RCA's trading volume sometimes accounted for 20% of the total volume on the New York Stock Exchange. At the stock price peak in September 1929, the company was ""valued"" at $665 million. Sales increased from $65 million in 1927 to $102 million in 1928 to $182 million in 1929. Therefore, at the peak of the RCA stock buying frenzy, the company was ""valued"" at a multiple of ""only"" 3.6 revenue. Forty-five years later, in 1974, RCA's annual sales were $4.6 billion, yet the stock price bottomed that year at $38, about one-third of its 1929 stock price high.?
While most rational investors consider Nvidia 'slightly' overvalued, market momentum could push fantasy valuations higher. Comparing the 1929 period of RCA and the current situation with Nvidia in 2023, one observes a similar pattern where most stocks experience decline while a handful of large companies powered the major indices higher. In both instances, unsuspecting investors maintained the illusion that the ""market"" was healthy.""",Will NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Benefit Disproportionately from the AI Boom?,425.03,421.79999,424.04999,7,2023,10

Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
45% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders
Insiders have been selling lately
Every investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA.
See our latest analysis for NVIDIA
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.
A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
Insider Ownership Of NVIDIA
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$42b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.
General Public Ownership
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

NVDA,2023-07-11 03:11:59,"""Tech maintains the strongest margins (24%) of any sector and far outpaces the S&P 500 (12%),"" Raymond James said.","Tech stocks were the ""clear first half MVP"" after rising nearly 40%, Raymond James said.
The firm said the fast-growing sector is poised to remain its ""all-star"" status in the second half of the year.
These are the four reasons why investors should keep betting on tech stocks, according to Raymond James.
After the Nasdaq 100's near-40% rally in the first half of the year, some investors are questioning whether now is the time to take profits and rotate into other areas of the market, or double down on the sector.
The surge in recent months was sparked by a massive earnings guidance boost from Nvidia, as the chipmaker benefits from the increased adoption of AI technologies. With the second-quarter reporting season kicking off later this week, investors' will be trying to gauge how durable the earnings growth will be for tech companies.
According to a Friday note from Raymond James chief investment officer Larry Adam, the growth should persist and tech stocks should retain their ""all-star"" status after taking the ""MVP"" title in the first half of the year.
""The performance by the Tech sector to-date was one for the record books. The sector posted its best first half of a year on record and is outpacing the S&P 500 by the widest margin over a six-month basis since 1999,"" Adam said.
These are the four reasons why Raymond James expects technology stocks to retain their ""all-star"" status in the second half of 2023.
1. Not as expensive as it appears
The technology sector is about 1% below its all-time high set in December 2021. Since then, its earnings have increased by about 5%, meaning its valuation has improved despite the near record highs for tech stocks. And the sector has a history of exceeding estimates.
""While the sector trades at a 42% premium to the S&P 500 on a next 12-month basis — the highest of any sector — it has beaten its earnings estimates by the largest amount in aggregate over the last 10 years, making it less expensive than current estimates suggest,"" Adam said.
2. High-margin businesses
The sharp stock market sell-off in 2022 recalibrated tech executives' focus away from growth and towards profits. That has led to a focus on efficiencies and significant cost cutting over the past few months, all in an effort to maintain or improve margins.
""This effort has paid off, as tech maintains the strongest margins (24%) of any sector and far outpaces the S&P 500 (12%). As we enter a period where returns will be more challenging as we likely enter a mild recession in the fourth quarter of 2023, an emphasis on maintaining the bottom line will be a key focus for investors (something that tech companies have proven capable of doing),"" he said.
3. Tech dominates investment
The recent wave of generative artificial intelligence highlights the fact that more and more companies are directing their spending to technology companies. More than 200 companies mentioned ""AI"" on their first-quarter earnings calls, Adam highlighted, adding that a recent industry survey suggested that about 65% of companies are planning to invest in AI.
""Already, tech spending accounts for ~62% of total corporate fixed investment (up from 35% in 2000). A continuation or acceleration of this trend will continue to support tech earnings,"" he said.
4. Diversification
Technology companies have grown more diversified since the dot-com bubble, and that should add to the resilience of the sector.
""For mega-cap tech, less than 50% of revenues come from tech-related products. Rather, the bulk of their earnings are more service oriented and derived from the consumer discretionary, communication services, financials and health care spaces,"" Adam said.","Tech stocks are set to hold onto their 'all-star' status in the 2nd half of this year for 4 reasons, Wall Street strategist says",421.79999,424.04999,439.01999,7,2023,11
NVDA,2023-07-11 09:40:36,Tech companies tend to care more about their profits than anything else.,"The explosion of investor interest in artificial intelligence has been one of the biggest stories of 2023.
But companies' shareholders care more about profits than anything else.
AI could transform business the way the internet did – or be consigned to the tech graveyard like the Metaverse was.
The sudden explosion of interest in ChatGPT has been one of the biggest stories for corporate America over the first half of 2023.
From massive conglomerates to tiny online florists, CEOs have turned the language bot into a buzzword in a bid to show that they're moving with the times as interest in artificial intelligence ramps up.
But eventually, companies will have to start showing their shareholders that the technology is going to help them make more money.
The second-quarter earnings season kicks off this week, starting a five-week period where investors get to see every S&P 500-listed firm's profits for the three months ending June 30.
Companies will have a chance to show that their increased spending on AI tech helped them make more money, over the quarter in which ChatGPT fully established itself in the public consciousness.
The early signs have been positive.
Semiconductor giant Nvidia became one of the AI boom's first winners when it released revenue forecasts that smashed Wall Street's targets, thanks to soaring demand for its chips.
Investors responded by loading up on its shares, propelling Jensen Huang's company to a $1 trillion valuation for the first time ever.
Zealots have used early success stories like Nvidia, Tesla, and other mega-cap names to argue that AI is like a new version of the internet – technology that outlasts a period of initial hype, and then transforms the way that business is done forever.
But for every dot-com boom there's so-called ""disruptive tech"" like crypto or the Metaverse – fads that end up losing companies money, rather than boosting their profits.
""The easy part is identifying this new technology that's breaking through,"" Jordan Stuart, a portfolio manager for Federated Hermes, told Insider. ""But finding companies that can actually make money using this technology is going to be really difficult.""
""Investors will say: 'Wow, this is a shiny new toy, but can I actually make money?'""

The top seven stocks in the index make up more than 50% of the index, with Apple and Microsoft alone making up about 25%.
These are the potential winners and losers of the Nasdaq 100 rebalance, according to Wells Fargo.
The surge in mega-cap tech stocks this year has helped push the concentration of the Nasdaq 100 index to its limits, and now a shake-up is about to happen.
Nasdaq said its popular Nasdaq 100 index would undergo a ""special rebalance"" later this month. That comes as the ""magnificent seven"" tech stocks now make up more than 50% of the index.
According to the methodology of the Nasdaq 100, a special rebalance may be conducted at anytime based on weighting restrictions ""if it is determined to be necessary to maintain the integrity of the index.""
Apple and Microsoft alone represent about 25% of the index as they each hover around a $3 trillion valuation. Their strong stock rallies this year helped push the Nasdaq 100 up nearly 40% in the first half of 2023. The rally took place as the market recovers from its 2022 bear market and as investors set their focus on the potential for artificial intelligence.
The seven mega-cap stocks that are likely set to see a reduction in their Nasdaq 100 weights include Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet.
The rebalance will be effective prior to the market open on Monday, July 24, and it will not result in the removal or addition of any stocks in the index.
Nasdaq announced the index shake-up late Friday after the market close. On Monday, investors sold the mega-cap tech stocks down as much as 2% in anticipation of the reweighting. Meanwhile, some stocks gained on the expectation that what's mega-cap tech stocks' pain will be their gain.
According to Wells Fargo equity analyst Chris Harvey, potential winners of the index shake-up that could see an increased allocation include Starbucks, Mondelez, Booking Holdings, Gilead Sciences, Intuitive Surgical, Analog Devices, and Automatic Data Processing.
The 2023 rebalance announcement was ""driven by Tesla's week-ago rally, causing the constituents weighting > 4.5% to exceed 48% of the index. Their collective weight will be down-sized to 40%,"" Harvey said in a recent note, adding that the biggest losers will be Apple and Microsoft, which should see their weight fall by almost 2% each.
The Nasdaq 100 shake-up shouldn't end the ongoing rally in technology stocks, according to Harvey.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - International Business Machines (IBM) is considering the use of artificial intelligence chips that it designed in-house to lower the costs of operating a cloud computing service it made widely available this week, an executive said Tuesday.
In an interview with Reuters at a semiconductor conference in San Francisco, Mukesh Khare, general manager of IBM Semiconductors, said the company is contemplating using a chip called the Artificial Intelligence Unit as part of its new ""watsonx"" cloud service.
IBM is hoping to take advantage of the boom in generative AI technologies that can write human-like text more than a decade after Watson, its first major AI system, failed to gain market traction.
One of the barriers the old Watson system faced was high costs, which IBM is hoping to address this time. Khare said using its own chips could lower cloud service costs because they are very power efficient.
IBM announced the chip's existence in October but did not disclose the manufacturer or how it would be used.
Khare said the chip is manufactured by Samsung Electronics, which has partnered with IBM on semiconductor research, and that his company is considering it for use in watsonx.
IBM has no set date for when the chip could be available for use by cloud customers, but Khare said the company has several thousand prototype chips already working.
IBM has joined other tech giants such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com in designing its own AI chips.
But Khare said IBM was not trying to design a direct replacement for semiconductors from Nvidia, whose chips lead the market in training AI systems with vast amounts of data.
Instead, IBM's chip aims to be cost-efficient at what AI industry insiders call inference, which is the process of putting an already trained AI system to use making real-world decisions.
""That's where the volume is right now,"" Khare said. ""We don't want to go toward training right now. Training is a different beast in terms of compute. We want to go where we can have the most impact.""

NVDA,2023-07-12 18:47:07,"In a few sectors, corporate concentration is a problem. In most, it needn’t be","GOVERNMENTS ARE at war with big business. In June Joe Biden, America’s president, spoke for many politicians the world over when he blamed it for greed-fuelled price rises, sluggish wage growth, forgone innovation and fragile supply chains. His trustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have been going after large deals merely because they are large—or at least that is how it feels. Courtroom defeats do not dampen the agency’s zeal. The latest came on July 11th, when a judge rejected its request to block Microsoft’s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a developer of video games. The ftc is expected to appeal against the ruling. The EU’s competition authorities are making noises about breaking up Google. Last year Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) derailed the $40bn acquisition by Nvidia, a semiconductor giant, of Arm, a chip-designer.
Trustbusters invoke three justifications for their renewed vigour: greater market concentration, reduced churn among the world’s biggest firms and rising corporate profits. On the surface all three point to rising corporate power. Look closely, though, and the trends may be the result of benign factors such as technological progress and globalisation. In some local markets, greater concentration may, paradoxically, have led to more competition, not less. And the covid-19 pandemic may have planted the seeds of a further competitive revival. Some big firms, it is true, have been collecting rents, including in big sectors such as health care. But trustbusters’ strategy—to reflexively question any deal involving a big firm—is wrongheaded.
That concentration has been rising is not in question. Across America’s economy it is higher today than at any point in at least the past century (see chart 1). Out of some 900 sectors in America tracked by The Economist, the number where the four biggest firms have a market share above two-thirds has grown from 65 in 1997 to 97 by 2017. In Europe, where the data are less comprehensive, market power has been increasing for at least 20 years. Using data on western Europe’s largest economies—Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain—Gabor Koltay, Szabolcs Lorincz and Tommaso Valletti, three economists, find that the market share of the four largest firms grew in 73% of some 700-odd industries from 1998 to 2019. The average increase was about seven percentage points. The proportion of firms with a share above 50% increased from 16% of industries to 27% by 1998 to 2019. Britain and France saw the biggest jumps.
At the same time, incumbent firms look more entrenched. In Britain, the average number of firms that stick in the top ten of their industries by market share three years later was five before the financial crisis. It is now closer to eight. Thomas Philippon of New York University’s Stern School of Business finds a similar reduction in churn among top American firms.
Most telling, firms are raking in higher profits. The Economist has come up with a crude estimate of “excess” profits for the world’s 3,000 largest listed companies by market value (excluding financial firms). Using reported figures from Bloomberg we calculate a firm’s hurdle rate of return on invested capital above 10% (excluding goodwill and treating research and development as an asset with a ten-year lifespan). This is the rate of return one might expect in a competitive market. In the past year excess profits reached $4trn, or nearly 4% of global GDP (see chart 2). They are highly concentrated in the West, especially America. American firms collect 41% of the total, with European ones taking 21%. The energy, technology and, in America, health-care industries stand out as excess-profit pools relative to their size.
All this looks troubling. And in certain sectors, it is. Four decades ago more than eight in ten hospitals were non-profits with a single location. Now more than six in ten are owned by sprawling for-profit hospital chains or academic networks such as Steward Health Care or Indiana University Health. At first this was a perfectly healthy process of big and efficient chains expanding across America. Two decades—and nearly 2,000 hospital mergers—later, things look ropey. An analysis from 2019 by Martin Gaynor of Carnegie Mellon University and colleagues suggests that such mergers have tended to raise prices without improving quality.
Still, high concentration, low churn and rich profits need not necessarily make consumers worse off. That concentration has been rising for 100 years, during which life has improved for virtually everyone, is the first clue that it may be the result of benign forces. Increases in industry concentration in America over the past century are correlated with greater technological intensity, higher fixed costs and higher output growth, according to Yueran Ma of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and colleagues. None of these seems particularly nefarious.
That concentration has also risen in Europe, where competition authorities have not been as sleepy as in America, likewise suggests that powerful structural forces are at play. John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics fingers technology and globalisation. The internet has reduced the cost of shopping around, even as software and other technology allow the best firms to scale up their operations around the world. Figures collected by McKinsey, a consultancy, show that the return on invested capital for a firm in the 75th percentile by this measure is 20 percentage points higher than for a median firm. “There are just huge economies of scale with software,” says Sterling Auty of MoffettNathanson, a research firm.
Local anti-heroes
Moreover, higher concentration at the country level may increase competition locally. Service industries in particular, which make up about half the 900-odd sectors in America’s census, are better examined at the local level. Fiona Scott Morton, a former deputy assistant attorney-general now at Yale School of Management, uses the example of coffee shops. With just one café in each neighbourhood, the national market would be hyperfragmented. But every consumer would face a local monopoly. “If I’m looking for a coffee, I’m not going to drive three hours,” she says.
Academics debate what exactly has happened to concentration in local markets. What seems increasingly clear is that the best firms have expanded into more and more of them. Walmarts, with their “everyday low prices”, cater to shoppers across America, thanks to the retail behemoth’s unrivalled logistics operation. Cheesecake Factory uses a laboratory in California to taste-test dishes that it quickly rolls out to its 200 or so locations around America. A recent paper titled “The Industrial Revolution in Services’‘, by Esteban Rossi-Hansberg at the University of Chicago and his co-author, shows that the geographic expansion of big firms increases competition for local incumbents, whose local market share falls.
As for low churn, it is not so bad if the incumbents keep innovating—which is what many are doing. Despite central banks pushing interest rates up at the fastest pace in decades in an attempt to quash inflation, American private investment in the first quarter of 2023 was 17.2% of GDP, similar to pre-pandemic highs. Many corporate behemoths are ploughing billions into innovation, including in areas that most worry trustbusters, such as technology. American tech’s big five—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft—collectively invested around $200bn in R&D last year, about a quarter of America’s total in 2021. Microsoft and Alphabet are at the forefront of the AI race.
Profits have, it is true, been higher in America since the financial crisis of 2007-09 than in previous decades, especially if you consider free cashflows, which accounts for the changing way companies depreciate assets (see chart 3). But they look somewhat less unusual if you adjust for lower tax rates and firms’ larger global footprint. And they may have peaked: analysts estimate that earnings for the S&P 500 index of American blue chips dipped in the three months to June, year on year, for the third quarter in a row.
Most heartening, far from being subdued, dynamism may be on the rise. John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland notes that business formation, which had been “quite anaemic” since the mid-2010s, has surged since the pandemic (see chart 4). In the past few years many more new firms have been created than old ones have been shut down. Whether these startups will dislodge incumbents is still unclear. But venture-capital investment suggests investors see scope for healthy returns. Although it is half what it was at its frothy peak of over $130bn in the fourth quarter of 2021, that has only brought it back to the levels of 2019 and 2020.
One hypothesis is that the remote-friendliness of the post-covid economy reduces startup costs. Young firms no longer need to rent a big office. They can hire from a less local talent pool. By our rough count, around 125 of the Census Bureau’s 900-odd industries benefit from rising e-commerce or can provide their services remotely. Consumers’ growing comfort with such options could inspire more new businesses to set up shop. Mr Haltiwanger already observes a small shift in the size distribution of firms towards smaller fry.
Concentration may also be levelling off as a result of subdued dealmaking, especially in tech. The big five tech firms’ share of all acquisitions by listed firms in America has fallen from nearly 1% in the 2010s to less than 0.5% since the start of Mr Biden’s tenure. Some of the slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is caused by the rising cost of capital and risk of recession. But renewed antitrust zeal must be playing a role. On June 27th American authorities updated their merger guidelines for the first time in 45 years, requiring firms to report far more details on deals worth over $110m, half the average deal size in 2022.
The biggest transactions are almost sure to be subject to a deep probe, which can add months to a filing process that now takes weeks. Regulators everywhere are throwing “sand in the gears of the M&A machine”, sighs a lawyer. “The FTC has stopped being discerning,” says another. Britain’s CMA “has probably overreached”, echoes a British one.
Such overzealous trustbusting carries its own risks. It may distract attention from more immediate threats to economic dynamism from bureaucratic restraints on land use or occupational licensing. Acquisitions can be useful for preserving the value of startups when subdued markets make it hard for founders to raise capital. And some big deals may benefit consumers, as when a biotech startup joins forces with established drugmakers to test and distribute a new therapy.

NVDA,2023-07-12 19:07:53,Nvidia remains a Wall Street darling.,"Investors are still buying into the notion that Nvidia (NVDA) will have a very hot summer as it cleans up in the generative AI arms race with its performance lead in chips.
That's even with growing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, which has fresh implications for tech.
The chip giant's stock is up 3% so far in July, outperforming the Nasdaq Composite's 1.2% gain. Shares are now up a sizzling 200% on the year, bringing the Jensen Huang-led tech creation to a market cap of more than $1 trillion.
Nvidia initially hit the $1 trillion market cap level on May 30.
""We continue to see upside to EPS of $10 in [calendar year 2023] for Nvidia (versus consensus $7.49), with our scenario implying growth to $30 by 2027 (at only 20% acceleration attach),"" Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse wrote in a new client note. ""Nvidia remains a top pick with beats and raises along with positive AI-related headlines driving continued momentum for shares through the year (and likely supporting the [semiconductor sector index] SOX higher as well).""
Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).
The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24.
Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.
The Street is currently projecting $11.02 billion in sales for Nvidia's second quarter, according to Yahoo Finance data.
Nvidia's shocking outlook has Wall Street bracing for big, positive guidance from the company when it reports earnings on Aug. 23.
Analysts expect Nvidia to add another $1 billion in sales alone from the second quarter's end to the third quarter's conclusion in October.
Despite the fundamental business momentum and love for the stock among investors, Nvidia's share price hasn't been Teflon in recent weeks.
The company's market cap fell back below the $1 trillion level on reports that the US is planning to impose new curbs on shipments of AI chips to China. The reports suggest the export curbs could begin in July.
Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said at a conference in late June the export curbs ""would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the US industry.""
Analysts have stuck with the company, however, and investors have pushed the valuation back above $1 trillion.
About 88% of the sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia rate the stock a Buy with an average price target of $470. If Nvidia hits that price target, the company's market cap would be about $1.24 trillion.
Pros say Nvidia is in too lucrative of a demand spot to ignore the stock.
""The recent step-function increase in the company’s data center revenue outlook, however, suggests that the company has entered a new phase of growth driven by the emergence and proliferation of generative AI,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari.

NVDA,2023-07-12 23:26:26,Nvidia is in discussions to acquire a stake in UK-based chip designer Arm before it goes public. The world's top chipmaker previously tried to acquire the same firm in 2020 – before US competition authorities blocked the move.,"Nvidia is in discussions to acquire a stake in UK-based chip designer Arm before it goes public.
A stake in Arm will complement Nvidia's competencies as the world's top chipmaker, as it rides the AI boom.
Nvidia previously tried to acquire Arm in 2020 – before US competition authorities blocked the move.
Nvidia is looking to expand its microchip empire as it gathers resources to support the artificial-intelligence revolution.
The world's most valuable semiconductor firm is in talks to buy a stake in the SoftBank-owned British chip designer Arm, ahead of its planned initial share offering later this year, the Financial Times reported. While nothing has been finalized yet, Arm is looking for Nvidia to become a so-called anchor investor, the outlet said.
Anchor investment is where an institution purchases a portion of a company's shares before it debuts on the stock market. It is a common tactic used in times of IPO downturn to provide a degree of certainty and reassure investors.
Per the FT, negotiations are currently focused on the UK-based company's valuation, which Nvidia sees around $40 billion, while Arm is holding out for nearer to $80 billion.
A stake in Arm will likely complement Nvidia's competencies as the world's leading chipmaker, as it prepares to take advantage of the artificial-intelligence boom that has taken markets by storm this year. The Santa Clara-based firm's stock is the best performer on the S&P 500 index this year – its share price rocketed almost 200% so far in 2023, boosting the company's market value above $1 trillion.
Nvidia's stock rally has been driven chiefly by investor perception that the company is well positioned to take advantage of the ongoing AI frenzy. The company is the No. 1 producer of graphics chips needed for high-intensity AI computing.
This is not the first time Nvidia and Arm have crossed paths. In 2020, the former was on the verge of acquiring the UK firm in a $40 billion deal – but at the last moment, US competition authorities blocked the move over concerns about restricting access to Arm's chip designs.
Now, as SoftBank unwinds its investment in the chipmaker, Arm is expected to go public as the most valuable company since EV carmaker Rivian debuted with a market capitalization of $66 billion in November 2021.",Nvidia is looking to expand its silicon empire as it rides the AI boom - the chipmaker is in discussions for a stake in the UK's Arm,424.04999,439.01999,459.76999,7,2023,12
NVDA,2023-07-13 03:06:05,Recursion has a library of 3 trillion searchable genes that will serve as the foundation for the company's AI-powered drug discovery program.,"Recursion Pharmaceuticals stock soared as much as 121% on Wednesday after it received an investment from Nvidia.
Nvidia said it would invest $50 million in the company as it works to use AI for drug discovery.
The surge in Recursion added more than $1 billion to its market valuation on Wednesday.
Shares of Recursion Pharmaceuticals soared as much as 121% on Wednesday after it said Nvidia invested $50 million in the biotech company.
Recursion, which utilizes artificial intelligence to help speed up the drug discovery process, said Nvidia's investment would accelerate its work in AI-powered drug development.
Both companies will collaborate on software for the biotech industry, with the hopes of more quickly creating patient treatments for a wide variety of ailments and diseases.
Recursion said it would rely on Nvidia's cloud services to develop its AI-enabled drug discovery models. Earlier this year, Nvidia announced the launch of BioNeMo, an AI drug discovery platform targeting the biotech industry.
""With our powerful dataset and NVIDIA's accelerated computing capabilities, we intend to create groundbreaking foundation models in biology and chemistry at a scale unlike anything that has ever been released in the biological space,"" Recursion CEO Chris Gibson said in a press release.
Recursion has a library of more than 3 trillion searchable gene and compound relationships, which will serve as the foundation of the company's drug discovery program.
The investment from Nvidia was executed as a private investment in a public equity, so the terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Recursion shared its outlook for 2023 with Insider earlier this year, which included an update on the four drugs it currently has under development for rare diseases, as well as details on a web application it recently launched called MolRec.
Shares of Recursion surged to a high of $14.99 in Wednesday's trading session before paring its gains to about 80%. The stock added more than $1 billion to its market valuation. Recursion went public in April 2021 and surged to a post-IPO high of $42.81. Since then, it has dropped 72%.",Recursion Pharmaceuticals soars 121% after Nvidia invests $50 million in the biotech for AI drug discovery,439.01999,459.76999,454.69,7,2023,13
NVDA,2023-07-13 13:47:37,"There are murmurings on Wall Street that the big tech-led year-to-date rally is about to run aground, but according to one prominent Wall Street analyst, that is not the case at all. In fact, the opposite is true, says Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, who believes many are in for a positive surprise as Q2 earnings season gets underway. “We believe a new tech bull market has begun to take shape being led by the AI Revolution and we expect to see a better-than-expected 2Q earnings season for the tech space","There are murmurings on Wall Street that the big tech-led year-to-date rally is about to run aground, but according to one prominent Wall Street analyst, that is not the case at all.
In fact, the opposite is true, says Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, who believes many are in for a positive surprise as Q2 earnings season gets underway. “We believe a new tech bull market has begun to take shape being led by the AI Revolution and we expect to see a better-than-expected 2Q earnings season for the tech space over the next few weeks,” the 5-star analyst opined.
According to Ives’ checks, catalyzed by not wanting to get left behind in the new AI-driven environment, in the June quarter, enterprise IT budgets have “started to show signs of improvement.”
And while the tech sector’s surge so far in 2023 has been built on multiple expansion rather than higher earnings, Ives thinks that is about to change. “We believe further evidence of this generational AI spending trend will be sprinkled in the forecasts/commentary from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, IBM, and other tech software/chip stalwarts during this key 2Q earnings season and be a catalyst for a broader tech rally ahead,” he explained.
With this in mind, we decided to get the lowdown on two equites Ives recommends investors load up on ahead of the anticipated surge. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, we found out that each boasts a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look.
Verint Systems (VRNT)
First up, Verint Systems, a global provider of software and services and a leading player in the field of customer experience management, workforce optimization, and surveillance technology. The company’s comprehensive suite of software applications enables organizations to capture, analyze, and act upon vast amounts of customer and security-related data, helping them make informed decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and improve overall performance.
The company is also heavily involved in the AI game via its Da Vinci platform, an advanced analytics and artificial intelligence platform that leverages machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and predictive analytics to extract actionable insights from various data sources.
Boosted by strong SaaS momentum, the company delivered a decent set of results in the most recent print – for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (April quarter). While revenues dropped by 0.6% year-over-year, the figure reached $216.6 million compared to the Street’s $216.1 estimate. Adj. EPS hit $0.53, also above the Street at $0.47. For FY24, the company stuck to its guidance and for total revenue of ~$935.0 million (+/- 2%), SaaS revenue to increase by 25% and pro forma EPS of $2.65 at the midpoint, the same as the Street expected.
The stock, though, has not been getting much love this year and has remained flat so far. However, Ives thinks the AI opportunity is about to play out.
“VRNT continues to incorporate generative AI within its platform as customer engagement is a top priority for enterprises,” the top analyst explained. “We believe that VRNT has well-positioned itself to be an AI winner due to its Da Vinci platform with its robust and diverse customer engagement data… We continue to believe Verint continues capitalizing on its SaaS transition to further strengthen its profitable growth profile despite the current operating environment.”
All told, Ives rates VRNT shares as Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $45 price target suggests the stock will climb 23% higher over the coming months. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)
5 other analysts have recently waded in with VRNT reviews, and like Ives, they are all positive, providing this stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target is a bit higher than Ives will allow; at $47.5, the figure makes room for 12-month returns of ~29%. (See VRNT stock forecast)
Palo Alto Networks (PANW)
For our next Ives-recommended tech name, we’ll turn to Palo Alto Networks, a leading cybersecurity company known for its innovative solutions in network security. Founded in 2005, the company has established itself as a trusted provider of next-generation firewall and advanced threat prevention systems. With its emphasis on prevention rather than just detection and response, Palo Alto Networks aims to help organizations proactively safeguard their networks and data from cyberattacks, enabling them to operate securely in today’s digital landscape.
It’s a value proposition well-suited for the modern world, and it has helped the company deliver positive results in the FQ3 readout (April quarter) of May. During the quarter, revenue grew by 24% compared to the same period last year, reaching $1.7 billion, while meeting Street expectations. Additionally, Billings increased by 26% year-over-year, amounting to $2.3 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS of $1.10 surpassed analysts’ forecasts by $0.17.
Looking ahead to FQ4, PANW anticipates revenue in the range of $1.937 billion to $1.967 billion, with the midpoint above the consensus at $1.95 billion. Moreover, adjusted EPS is projected to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.30, compared to analysts’ estimate of $1.18.”
That’s the sort of stuff the Street likes and despite a recent pullback over fears Microsoft is about to enter the cybersecurity arena, the shares have put in an excellent display in the tech-led rally – up by 70% year-to-date.
That’s not to say the stock has no room left to run. There’s more goodness on the way, according to Daniel Ives, who writes, “Based on our recent checks we believe the PANW cloud growth story is set to hit its next stage of growth and remains in a golden position of success over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe the risk/reward on this cyber security bellwether makes it a table pounder at current levels as the free cash flow story ramps further in Jokic-like fashion heading into FY24.”
Accordingly, Ives rates PANW shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) to go alongside a $290 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 22% from current levels.
Overall, this is a stock with plenty of coverage and almost all of it positive. Barring two Holds, all 29 other reviews say Buy, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The $257.59 average target suggests shares will generate 8.5% returns in the months ahead. (See PANW stock forecast)

Several analysts expect companies to surpass the beaten-down estimates but some have warned this may not be enough to sustain gains in equities seen so far in 2023. Much of the stock market rally this year has been driven by a price-to-earnings expansion, signaling investors likely remain unconcerned about near-term earnings pressure.","(Reuters) - Analysts are cautiously optimistic as second-quarter reporting season rolls out amid this year's rally in U.S. stocks fueled by optimism over artificial intelligence (AI) and a resilient U.S. economy.
Strategists expect profit at S&P 500 companies to have dropped 6.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
Several analysts expect companies to surpass the beaten-down estimates but some have warned this may not be enough to sustain gains in equities seen so far in 2023.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has surged 33% this year due to a scorching rally in AI-linked stocks versus a 16% advance in the S&P 500.
Morgan Stanley:
Much of the stock market rally this year has been driven by a price-to-earnings expansion, signaling investors likely remain unconcerned about near-term earnings pressure.
Still, ""better-than-feared"" earnings are not going to be good enough in Q2 considering stocks have become more expensive, the strategists say.
Earnings are unlikely to disappoint given low expectations, but adds companies would need to hike profit forecasts to support valuations, which are under threat from lower liquidity.
Goldman Sachs:
Companies will likely be able to beat or surpass ""the low bar"" set for the second quarter. However, GS believes consensus earnings estimates for 2024 are too optimistic, pointing to concerns about the ability of firms to maintain profit margins at a time when inflation is cooling.
AI is a big focus this earnings and guidance from companies such as Nvidia will help investors identify long-term beneficiaries, per the Wall Street bank.
BlackRock:
Better-than-expected earnings have not been a major driver of returns this year, given the AI-fueled rally, says Laura Cooper, senior macro strategist for iShares EMEA at BlackRock.
Cooper cautions against a broad re-allocation to risk assets, saying there are only certain sectors such as energy and healthcare where estimates have factored in effects of economic damage.
Deutsche Bank:
While earnings have historically been favorable for equities, the extent of the rally depends upon equity positioning going into the reporting season.
This suggests a ""muted market reaction"" to Q2 earnings is likely, given robust gains in stocks since the first quarter and an ""overweight"" equity positioning, the bank says.
Still, strategists at the German bank say there is a chance this season could push equities higher, as it expects Q2 to mark a second straight quarter of sequential earnings growth which could change emerging expectations of an impending earnings recession.
Wells Fargo:
Investors are ""discounting the effects of higher-for-longer rates on earnings"", which is a mistake.
Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, believes the Fed is not done raising interest rates and earnings for S&P 500 companies are likely be lower this year than in 2022, with the economy slipping into a recession.
BofA:
Earnings pressure is likely to bottom out in Q2 and margins for most sectors to stabilize going forward. The brokerage says companies are likely to highlight improved business conditions after a trough in the March-April period.
This bodes well for economically sensitive sectors, according to BofA, which forecasts a rally in cyclical stocks in the latter half of the year.
Citigroup
While positive surprises are likely, particularly from technology and industrial sectors, there is ample reason for caution as investors seem ""ripe to punish stocks that do not exceed expectations.""
As a result, highly crowded stocks, such as major AI names, are most at risk this earnings season, according to the bank.

The stocks markets have been through the wringer in the recent past following the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Supply chain disruptions and other issues caused by these major events in the global arena led to inflationary pressures across the world which demanded strong monetary policy measures from governments. Rising interest rates put a dampener on the stock markets which led to one of the worst years in 2022 for the equity markets since 2008.
Of the three major U.S. stock indices, NASDAQ 100 fared the worst, declining more than 30% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating fears of a recession. You can read more about this in our last episode of the 12 best most active stocks to buy now, published in late December.
The indices have since recovered most of their losses in 2023 as interest rate increases have slowed down and fears of a hard landing have tapered off. The NASDAQ 100 index is at the forefront of the stock market recovery as the index is already 39% up year-to-date with multiple constituents of the index benefiting from the AI boom. The chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution and has seen a massive 195% surge in its share prices year-to-date, surpassing the trillion dollar mark for market capitalization.
The sentiment in the stock markets also turned bullish on July 12 following the release of latest CPI figures which proved to be better than expectations. In June, the CPI rose 3% y-o-y as compared to an expectation of a 3.1% increase. Similarly, core CPI and month-over-month CPI increase, which rose 0.2%, also increased less than the forecasts.
Our list of 13 best most active stocks to buy now includes some of the most notable names in the stock markets and includes several trillion dollar companies.

NVDA,2023-07-14 04:16:01,The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed at new highs for the year. Commentators are seeing a soft landing of the economy more likely as inflation cools.,"US stocks rose on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closing at highs for 2023.
Thursday's producer price index further established the disinflation narrative after Wednesday's cooler CPI.
Analysts and commentators are eyeing a soft landing of the economy as increasingly likely.
More signs of slowing price growth helped US stocks climb on Thursday, sending the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 to their highest levels of the year.
The disinflation narrative deepened as the Producer Price Index rose 0.1% year-over-year in June, the slowest rate of growth in nearly three years. The reading was better than expected, and added to Wednesday's encouraging Consumer Price Index report that showed inflation cooling to 3% last month.
The reports are fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon back away from its campaign of aggressively tightening monetary policy, though most expect one more hike at the end of this month. Cooling inflation and a steady slowing of the labor market have built up confidence among some analysts that a soft landing can still be achieved.
Tech led stocks higher Thursday, with Nvidia jumping nearly 5% and Alphabet up more than 4%. Cryptocurrency XRP rallied 61% after a US judge determined it was not a security.

""It's starting to feel a little manic. But it could go on for quite a bit longer because as long as the economic data is OK, I don't see why people are going to sell their stocks,"" Eisman said in a CNBC interview on Thursday.
Eisman was likely pointing to recent economic data that has suggested the US is in better shape than most Americans think.
Inflation is rapidly cooling, the job market has stayed robust with low unemployment, and sustained equity gains have helped push the S&P 500 into a bull market.
This year's stock rally has got a big boost from investor excitement over the rise of artificial intelligence, with investors piling into popular tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.
""I would say I'm surprised by how much the market has gone up this year. I really am,"" Eisman said.
The equity market has stayed ebullient even as the Federal Reserve extended its interest-rate increases – which started in March 2022 – to a staggering 500 basis points in a bid to tame inflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market in 2023 are set to report earnings in coming weeks, potentially determining the path for this year’s equity rally.
Lately dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors, shares of the U.S. companies with the biggest market values soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year. Those moves have accounted for a lion's share of the S&P 500's 17% year-to-date rise and propelled the index to its highest level since April 2022.
The outsized gains have come with big earnings expectations for the seven companies: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. BofA Global Research projects they will increase earnings by an average of 19% over the next 12 months, more than double the an 8% estimated rise for the rest of the S&P 500.
They will need strong results to justify premium valuations. Those companies trade at an overall trailing price-to-earnings ratio of about 40 times, versus 15 times for the S&P 500 excluding those companies, according to BofA.
Their results may be crucial to the market as a whole. Fueled by their recent gains, megacap stocks have climbed to dominate benchmark indexes, causing headaches for some managers of active funds. In the S&P 500, the seven stocks comprise 27.9% of the index's weight.
Investors will look beyond second quarter results, said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders.
“It’s also how do these big companies, which are carrying the market ... guide for the rest of the year and into 2024,” he said.
Overall, the seven companies account for 14.3% of overall S&P 500 estimated earnings for the second quarter, and 9.3% of estimated revenue, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv.
Among the reports in the previous quarter, Nvidia was one of the standouts. The semiconductor company's revenue forecast blew past estimates as it said it was boosting supply to meet surging demand for its artificial-intelligence chips, further fanning the market's excitement over AI. Nvidia shares are up well over 200% this year
Tesla is the first of the growth giants to report, with earnings expected on Wednesday. The Elon Musk-led company this month said it delivered a record number of vehicles in the second quarter.
Microsoft and Meta are among the companies due to report the following week, and investors are expected to focus on how companies are seeking to harness AI.
While AI benefits may not immediately materialize for every company, investors are eager to learn ""more about how they are going to convert that into money, essentially,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.
""It’s going to take some time for that to work its way through and to show up,"" said Martin, who is overweight some of the megacap stocks. ""Along the way, people are going to want to see some sort of progress.""
There are signs market gains are broadening beyond the megacaps. The equal-weight S&P 500, a proxy for the average stock, is modestly beating the S&P 500 over the past month -- up 3.6% versus about 3% for its counterpart. The equal-weight version trailed badly for most of 2023. Strong U.S. data have driven confidence the economy can avoid a long-feared recession. A so-called ""soft-landing"" could lift cyclical stocks such as industrials and small-caps that are trading at cheaper valuations. But many investors say the corporate giants are nevertheless here to stay as critical holdings. Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said that while “there is a lot priced in” to megacaps’ valuations, that did not mean they are overvalued.
""If you think about the megacaps broadly ... they have gone from a core holding of a portfolio to an almost absolute necessary major component of the portfolio once you factor in trends such as AI,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The chief executives of Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc are planning to visit Washington next week to discuss China policy, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The executives plan to hold meetings with U.S. officials to talk about market conditions, export controls and other matters affecting their businesses, one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear whom the executives would meet.
Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment, and officials at the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
The sources said other semiconductor CEOs may also be in Washington next week. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
U.S. officials are considering tightening export rules affecting high-performance computing chips and shipments to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, sources told Reuters in June. The rules would respectively affect Intel, which is preparing a new artificial intelligence chip that could be shipped to China, and Qualcomm, which has a license to sell chips to Huawei.
The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China's semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its own chip industry.
The possible rule tightening would hit Nvidia particularly hard. The company's strong position in the AI chip market helped boost its worth to $1 trillion earlier this year.

While it’s hard to sustain those types of returns over the long run, it takes a return of “only” about 14% per year to double your money in five years. If you pick the right individual stock, you could easily snag that type of return. In fact, some stocks can double your money even faster, as Tesla, Nvidia, Royal Caribbean Cruises and others have already demonstrated in 2023.
Still, it’s important to remember that stocks that have the capability of doubling rapidly also generally carry a higher amount of risk than others. You should always consult with your financial advisor to ensure your risk profile matches the stocks that you want to buy.
But, if you can handle the wild swings of a high-flying stock, take a look at the names below, each of which has the potential to double or even go higher still in the next five years.
Enphase Energy (ENPH)
Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $182.78
Enphase Energy is an aggressive play that should either win big or lose spectacularly. For years — decades even — speculators have hoped, prayed and gambled that it was finally the time for solar stocks to take off.
While solar as a whole is still in the starting gate, in terms of nationwide implementation, some stocks have already done spectacularly well. Enphase Energy is one of those companies, returning a whopping 2,500% over the past five years, even after an incredible drop of 46% from its all-time high in mid-2023.
Still, Enphase Energy somehow remains under the radar of many investors. Analysts have a strong buy rating on the stock, with an average 12-month price target 39% above current levels.
Warning: Bank of America Says Stocks Are Headed for ‘Big Collapse’
Tesla (TSLA)
Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $271.99
Tesla is one of the most controversial stocks in the market today, thanks in part to its outspoken genius of a founder, Elon Musk. But there’s no denying that the company has absolutely revolutionized the electric vehicle market, and it may only be beginning.
Tesla is miles ahead of the competition when it comes to developing electric vehicles that are both desirable and profitable, and it’s dedicated to cutting the cost of EV production in half to further stem competition. Its advances in battery storage technology and the integration of artificial intelligence into its vehicle universe are just some of the cutting-edge technologies that will help the company going forward, and its recent deal to allow competitors to use its superchargers will be yet another big source of revenue.
Note that the stock is notoriously volatile and already has had a huge run in 2023, so it’s a name you might want to average your way into over time.
Nvidia (NVDA)
Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $439.05
Nvidia has always been a popular stock on Wall Street, but the company’s stock price has absolutely exploded in 2023, up 189.5% YTD as of June 30. That was enough to make Nvidia the best-performing stock in the first half of 2023.
Much of the rally was due to the fact that Nvidia has become the de facto poster child for AI. As the world’s leading producer of microprocessors that make advanced artificial intelligence functions possible, Nvidia is seen as the clear winner in a world seemingly destined to be saturated with AI.
While some giveback is likely, it’s important to remember that Nvidia stock actually fell by more than 50% in 2022, making its two-year return less irrational. Over the next five years, Nvidia is likely to continue being the dominant player in the industry, perhaps propelling the stock to even more stratospheric gains.
Chipotle (CMG)
Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $2,077.10
Chipotle Mexican Grill might not have the sizzle that some of the tech stocks on this list might, but it’s been a huge winner for long-term investors — and more seems to be in store. Over the past five years, the company’s share price has more than quadrupled; but, with the way the company innovates, there may be much more in store.
Just recently, the company unveiled its avocado processing robot, dubbed Autocado, that peels, cores and cuts avocados before they are passed on to human workers for transformation into guacamole. The company claims this will cut processing time in half, translating into more production and higher sales. With a devoted fan base that continues to grow, Chipotle could continue its string of winning years.
Alphabet (GOOGL)
Stock price as of July 12, 2023: $118.98
Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, is forecast to post earnings growth of 11.1% next year, according to analysts at Bank of America.
Already the world’s leading search engine, Alphabet is positioning itself to benefit from the rising AI wave. Google’s search results and the personalization of its core products like YouTube are already benefiting from AI and machine learning, and this will only accelerate in the future.
The same is true of the company’s advertising and cloud computing businesses. But what many people may not know is that Alphabet runs much deeper than its headline-making businesses. AI can help many of its less well-known divisions, such as its life sciences and self-driving car businesses, make huge technological leaps in the coming years.
Analysts maintain a strong buy rating on the company, which has posted a 102% gain — more than doubling — over the past five years.

The inclusion of senior administration officials in the meeting highlights the pressure the Biden administration is facing from chipmakers, who worry new restrictions on sales of them and related equipment to China will cut them off from their largest market and ultimately undermine US leadership in the industry.
Brainard and Sullivan, along with other officials, will sit down with the leaders of Intel Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., companies that have lobbied forcefully against the new curbs.
Nvidia and Qualcomm declined to comment about Monday’s meeting, while Intel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The US, where most of the chip technology originates, believes restricting China’s access will bolster national security and hold back Beijing’s efforts to advance its military capabilities. The Biden administration is set to roll out new restrictions in the coming weeks, people familiar with the matter said. The administration aims to update and finalize the measures by strengthening what’s already been announced.
The Commerce Department in October issued rules that bar semiconductor equipment makers from selling certain tools to China, as well as prohibit the export of some chips used in artificial intelligence applications — an announcement that roiled the industry.

The Semiconductor Industry Association said Monday that “overly broad, ambiguous and at times unilateral restrictions risk diminishing the US semiconductor industry’s competitiveness, disrupting supply chains, causing significant market uncertainty and prompting continued escalatory retaliation by China.”
A National Security Council spokesperson, in response to SIA, said the administration’s “actions have been carefully tailored to focus on technology with national security implications, and designed to ensure that US and allied technologies are not used to undermine our national security.”
“We have been deliberate about getting this right, including through extensive public comment on regulations, and through intensive coordination with allies and partners, the Hill, industry, and other stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.
Qualcomm gets more than 60% of its revenue from the China region, where it supplies components to smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who visited Beijing earlier this month to show off his company’s latest artificial intelligence chips, counts the nation as his biggest sales region, with China providing about a quarter of its sales. For Nvidia, run by co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, China provides about a fifth of revenue.
So far, chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc. have taken the biggest hits to revenue, being forced to knock billions of dollars off their projections. But the restrictions, which companies fear will be extended to other classes of chips, are also affecting some device makers. Nvidia’s ability to ship its industry-leading artificial intelligence accelerators to China has been curbed by an approval process, costing it sales.
The US is using some of its powers to influence overseas companies to further cut off China’s access. ASML Holding NV, one of the biggest providers of chipmaking equipment, is facing tighter restrictions from its home government in the Netherlands and new restrictions from the US, because some of its components are made in America.
In its statement Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association called on the US and Chinese governments “to ease tensions and seek solutions through dialogue, not further escalation.”

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC is expected to report a 27% fall in second-quarter net profit on Thursday, as global economic woes dent demand for semiconductors, though analysts say business performance is likely to improve in the current quarter.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple and Nvidia supplier, is likely to report net profit for the April-June period of T$172.53 billion ($5.58 billion), down from T$237.0 billion a year earlier, according to the average of 21 analysts polled by Reuters.
The forecast decline in profit partly reflects a robust performance in the previous year, when the company was still riding high on pent-up post-pandemic demand.
Analysts at Taiwan's Fubon Investment said they expected the second quarter to be the bottom of the current downcycle but that while the situation should improve in the third quarter, it would be weaker than normal given continued inventory build ups that are still being worked through.
One senior Taiwan fund manger told Reuters that third quarter profit would bounce back given expectations for AI demand and launches of new iPhones ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season.
""Taiwan has not really benefited from electric vehicles, since the market is in China and most EV suppliers are in China. But artificial intelligence (AI) is a different story,"" he said, requesting anonymity citing company policy. ""Taiwan will benefit most from AI because the entire AI supply chain can be found here.""
The second quarter is traditionally a slow period for sales for the tech industry with demand usually picking up in the third quarter and towards the year-end shopping season.
TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed company, posted a surprise rise in net profit for the quarter ended March, up 2% from a year earlier. But that was still the smallest quarterly growth since mid-2019 as global economic woes hurt demand for chips.
Last month, the company said quickly rising demand for AI applications was driving a lot of orders and that it expected a better performance in the second half than the first.
The bright outlook for AI applications has in part driven up TSMC's Taipei-listed stock by almost 30% so far this year, outperforming the broader market, which is up around 22%.
The company will provide guidance for the third quarter and update previous forecasts on its earnings call at 0600 GMT on Thursday.
TSMC's second quarter revenue came in at T$480.8 billion($15.53 billion), according to Reuters calculations, in the middle of an April forecast range of $15.2 billion to $16 billion, compared to $18.16 billion for the year-ago period.

The company is planning to file for the first-time share sale as soon as the coming weeks, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Meanwhile, the startup is also in talks with investors including state-backed funds in Guangzhou for a separate funding round, which could raise about 2 billion yuan ($279 million), the people said.
Deliberations are ongoing and Biren hasn’t decided on the size of the IPO, the people said. The details of the prospective fundraising including size and timeline could still change, they added. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Biren’s fundraising efforts come as the Chinese government accelerates its campaign to develop its domestic semiconductor industry, after a US-led effort that blocked Chinese companies’ ability to buy advanced chips, including some Nvidia products used to develop artificial-intelligence capabilities. Founded in 2019, Biren focuses on areas such as graphics processing units and cloud computing, and is considered one of the most promising domestic contenders to Nvidia, the leader in the field.
The startup has raised about 4.7 billion yuan from investors including IDG Capital, Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Merchants Capital. Last year, it was seeking to raise funds again at a valuation of 17 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), Bloomberg News reported at that time. It also declared in August 2022 it had released the first general-purpose graphics processing unit, “setting a new record in global computing power.”

Biren’s ambitions for chipmaking have been put to the test amid sweeping restrictions from President Joe Biden’s administration on China’s access to semiconductor technology. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading maker of customized chips for companies like Apple Inc., suspended production of advanced silicon for Biren to ensure compliance with US regulations, Bloomberg News reported in October.
Back in the local market, Biren’s products are getting traction among major Chinese firms as it’s gearing up for its Hong Kong IPO, according to the people. The startup has secured orders from SenseTime Group Inc., which recently unveiled a suite of new AI services including SenseChat, a challenger to the AI phenom ChatGPT, the people said.
SenseTime declined to comment. TSMC declined to comment on any customer relationships, but said that, as a law-abiding company, it complies with all relevant rules and regulations.

The company is planning to file for the first-time share sale as soon as the coming weeks, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Meanwhile, the startup is also in talks with investors including state-backed funds in Guangzhou for a separate funding round, which could raise about 2 billion yuan ($279 million), the people said.
Deliberations are ongoing and Biren hasn’t decided on the size of the IPO, the people said. The details of the prospective fundraising including size and timeline could still change, they added. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Biren’s fundraising efforts come as the Chinese government accelerates its campaign to develop its domestic semiconductor industry, after a US-led effort that blocked Chinese companies’ ability to buy advanced chips, including some Nvidia products used to develop artificial-intelligence capabilities. Founded in 2019, Biren focuses on areas such as graphics processing units and cloud computing, and is considered one of the most promising domestic contenders to Nvidia, the leader in the field.
The startup has raised about 4.7 billion yuan from investors including IDG Capital, Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Merchants Capital. Last year, it was seeking to raise funds again at a valuation of 17 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), Bloomberg News reported at that time. It also declared in August 2022 it had released the first general-purpose graphics processing unit, “setting a new record in global computing power.”

Biren’s ambitions for chipmaking have been put to the test amid sweeping restrictions from President Joe Biden’s administration on China’s access to semiconductor technology. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s leading maker of customized chips for companies like Apple Inc., suspended production of advanced silicon for Biren to ensure compliance with US regulations, Bloomberg News reported in October.
Back in the local market, Biren’s products are getting traction among major Chinese firms as it’s gearing up for its Hong Kong IPO, according to the people. The startup has secured orders from SenseTime Group Inc., which recently unveiled a suite of new AI services including SenseChat, a challenger to the AI phenom ChatGPT, the people said.
SenseTime declined to comment. TSMC declined to comment on any customer relationships, but said that, as a law-abiding company, it complies with all relevant rules and regulations.

This is the first partnership with a large language model provider that McKinsey has announced as it joins other global consulting firms to tap into the global AI frenzy kicked off by the popular Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT.,"By Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Consultancy giant McKinsey said it had struck a partnership with artificial intelligence startup Cohere in an effort to provide AI solutions to its enterprise clients.
This is the first partnership with a large language model provider that McKinsey has announced as it joins other global consulting firms to tap into the global AI frenzy kicked off by the popular Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT.
""We are seeing our clients consider cost, IP protection and consumer privacy, and how the model is trained. We found Cohere to be one of the great solutions out there,"" Ben Ellencweig, senior partner at McKinsey, told Reuters in an interview.
McKinsey said it was working with Cohere to build customized solutions to help improve customer engagement and workflow automation for clients. It added it was also considering using Cohere to increase its internal efficiency and power the knowledge management system at McKinsey.
The two companies said they have worked together to serve companies across industries, from financial services to retail, without disclosing any names.
Founded by former top AI researchers at Alphabet's Google, Cohere has positioned itself as a neutral provider for enterprises to use models that are not tied to cloud providers like Microsoft. Cohere competes with OpenAI with a focus on generative AI solutions for enterprises.
Last month, Cohere raised $270 million from investors including Nvidia, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures at a $2.2 billion valuation.
It also announced a partnership with Oracle, which will embed Cohere's generative AI technology in its products.
""This was very much part of our strategy when we decided the best way to really have this technology impact the world would be through enterprises and through some really strong and complementary partners like McKinsey,"" said Martin Kon, president at Cohere.
Among other consulting firms that have struck partnerships and made AI investments are Accenture, which announced a $3 billion investment in AI, while PwC said in April that it would invest $1 billion over the next three years.
Bain and Company has teamed up with OpenAI, while Deloitte has partnered with chipmaker Nvidia.

NVDA,2023-07-18 17:29:47,Citi boosted its price target for Nvidia to $520 a share in what markets guru Larry McDonald mocked as poor sell-side research.,"Markets guru Larry McDonald took a dig at Citi, which raised its price target for Nvidia's stock following its rally of over 200%.
""The clown show rolls on,"" McDonald said, seemingly mocking Wall Street's tendency to follow the market rather than lead it.
Last year, Citi had trimmed its price target for Nvidia, citing a decline in gaming demand.
Citi just boosted its price target for Nvidia's stock – but markets guru Larry McDonald isn't impressed.
""The clown show rolls on - cut the price target on the lows - raise the price target on the highs - sell side 'research,'"" markets guru and founder of ""The Bear Traps Report"" said in a tweet on Monday.
He seemed to suggest it's typical for Wall Street analysts to simply raise targets once shares rally and cut them when prices have already fallen -- thereby following the market rather than leading it. Citi's move to raise its target for Nvidia follows a massive year-to-date rally of more than 200% for the chipmaker.
The New York-based bank lifted its goal for Nvidia shares to $520 apiece from $420 earlier, with analyst Atif Malik adding the semiconductor company's stock could surge as high as $600.
Shares in the Santa Clara-based firm rose 2.81% to $464.61 on Monday.
""To us, it is clear the market for [artificial-intelligence] accelerators is bound to grow at a blistering pace,"" he said in a note, per MarketWatch. He added that Nvidia will have ""a substantial advantage in AI performance versus AMD going forward,"" that'll see the company hold about a 90% share of the AI accelerator market.
Citi has flip-flopped on its forecasts for Nvidia. Last year, the bank slashed its price target for the chipmaker to $285 a share on faltering gaming demand, per several outlets.
Nvidia has stunned investors this year with an eye-popping 218% surge, thanks to a boom in artificial intelligence technologies. The rally has pushed Nvidia into the elite $1 trillion market cap club for the first time.
The sizzling stock gains have also pumped up the wealth of the company's CEO Jensen Huang to $39.2 billion, making him the 34th richest person in the world, per the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.","Wall Street research is a 'clown show', markets guru Larry McDonald says after Citi boosts its price target for Nvidia's stock",464.60999,474.94,470.76999,7,2023,18

NVDA,2023-07-19 09:00:00,"Tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been trying to control spending. Nvidia and the AI arms race is changing this austerity.","Big tech companies have been trying to keep a lid on spending plans.
Nvidia is selling billions of dollars worth of GPUs for AI data centers.
Both things can't be happening at the same time.
2023 was supposed to be the year of austerity for Big Tech. The AI arms race is changing that.
Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have cut thousands of jobs in the past year, while trimming capital expenditure plans to please Wall Street. It worked. Their shares rebounded a lot.
Enter Nvidia and the generative AI boom. It sells GPUs, special chips that are used to train these big new AI models. For its upcoming quarter, the company forecast $11 billion in revenue, up 64% from a year earlier. Most of that growth is coming from AI demand, especially in the data center space.
The biggest operators of data centers are Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. They are also big AI model developers and major customers of Nvidia. So how can these tech giants be keeping a lid on spending, while Nvidia sales are surging?
For a while, some analysts and investors tried to believe both things were happening at once. It's nice to have your cake and eat it. Logic and math have begun to prevail now, though. And the expectation is that Big Tech is going back to splurging again.
""Increasing CAPEX across the board is probably the worst kept secret on Wall Street,"" Mark Shmulik, a top tech analyst at Bernstein Research, wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday that previews some of the upcoming Big Tech earnings season. ""All those Nvidia GPUs have to be going somewhere.""
Here's what Morgan Stanley analysts think will happen to Big Tech spending habits:
Google capex will rise 4% to about $33 billion in 2023 and 8% to roughly $35 billion in 2024. That will be driven by a 31% jump in technical infrastructure spending this year, and a 15% increase next year.
The analysts are forecasting Meta capex of $33 billion this year, at the high end of the company's guidance. Next year, capex will rise about 9% to $36 billion, powered by growth in infrastructure spending to support AI recommendation algorithms and generative AI.
Amazon's AWS technical infrastructure capex will climb about 8% this year to $37 billion. It will pop 15% in 2024 to reach $42 billion.
""We see more potential upside risk to '24 capex estimates than '23,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note. ""In many ways, given the opportunity these AI tools create (and the data/distribution advantages these large companies have) we hope they spend as much as they can…provided they can deliver and communicate the incremental ROIC for investors.""
ROIC stands for return on invested capital. Another translation might be: These companies better make good money on all this AI stuff.",Tech giants are supposed to be spending less. Nvidia is selling boatloads of GPUs. Both things can't be happening at once.,474.94,470.76999,455.20001,7,2023,19

Apple has so far held back from any big moves in AI and even avoided mentioning the buzzword at its developer conference in June - in stark contrast to other tech giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft which have made bold moves to incorporate the breakthrough technology.
Shares of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet dropped more than 1% after the report.
Apple has, however, subtly pushed advanced AI in some of its products such as Apple Photos, on device texting, and the recently launched mixed-reality headset Vision Pro. Still, analysts say the company is behind peers in incorporating the new technology.

Elon Musk reacted to the pair's massive increase in market cap by tweeting: ""Crazy times.""
Musk once tweeted that Tesla stock was overvalued, and complained about its volatility.
Elon Musk underlined the astounding scale of Microsoft and Nvidia's combined market-value surge on Tuesday with a two-word tweet: ""Crazy times.""
While Musk didn't spell out whether he views Microsoft or Nvidia as overvalued, his strong reaction could be a red flag for investors.
What's going on with Microsoft and Nvidia?
Microsoft stock jumped 4% on Tuesday after it unveiled a $30 AI subscription for its Office 365 platform. Meanwhile, Nvidia rose 2% after a Citi analyst raised his price target for the stock and suggested it could surge nearly 30%. Both stocks continue to ride the wave of excitement around artificial intelligence, as investors bet the technology will dramatically boost productivity and supercharge providers' profits.
Combined, the computing titan and microchip maker gained as much as $192 billion in market capitalization during Tuesday's intraday trading. They ended the day with respective increases of $102 billion and $26 billion.
Microsoft shares have soared 50% this year to trade at a record high, which has added around $900 billion to the company's market cap. Nvidia has performed even better — its 225% gain has more than tripled its market cap to almost $1.2 trillion.
Put another way, both companies' market values have increased by more than the entire market cap of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ($756 billion) this year.
Could Musk's tweet be a red flag?
Musk's exclamation about Microsoft and Nvidia isn't surprising; he tweeted ""Wild T$1mes"" after Tesla's market cap crossed $1 trillion in November 2020. However, the Twitter owner and Tesla and SpaceX CEO has warned about overheated and volatile stocks in the past.
""Tesla stock price is too high imo,"" he tweeted in May 2020, spooking his own shareholders and sending his company's stock downward.
Musk also complained the automaker's stock price was ""being set in kind of a manic-depressive way,"" and called it ""a bit of a distraction,"" on a Tesla earnings call in 2019.
""Warren Buffett's analogy is that being a publicly traded company is like having someone stand at the edge of your home and just randomly yell different prices for your house every day,"" Musk added. ""It's still the same house.""
Musk hasn't been complaining recently, perhaps because Tesla's stock price has skyrocketed from below $30 to over $290 since 2019, adjusted for the electric-vehicle maker's two stock splits. The surge has boosted the value of Musk's stake in Tesla; he's now the world's wealthiest person with a $256 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
It's worth emphasizing that Musk has been firing off short replies such as ""wow"" and ""!"" to many tweets in recent weeks, as he seeks to boost engagement on Twitter after buying it last year. ""Crazy times"" might just be another offhand response, but it could also signal he's taken aback by the magnitude of Big Tech stock moves today.",Elon Musk chimes in after Microsoft and Nvidia gain as much as $192 billion in market value in a day.

A New All-Time-High
The stock jumped 4%, closing at $359.49, and breaking the previous record of $348.10 from June 15th, rising about 50% for the year.
Microsoft’s AI Offering
It’s no secret that Microsoft has been heavily investing in generative AI, largely through a multibillion-dollar investment in the creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, as well as into Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) AI chips to power its AI development. What Microsoft aims to do is help create a true match to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) who dominates the chip market with its 80 to 90% share and by doing so, reduce the cost of AI hardware.
Its AI service, Microsoft Copilot, that was previously announced in March is able to design presentations and write prompts, replacing an assistant in summarizing business meetings and helping those with poor organizational skills prioritize their inbox. It’s undergoing testing by as many as 600 customers, including General Motors (NYSE: GM).
Unlike Microsoft, Amazon Is Developing Its Own Chips
Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) might have entered with e-commerce declines and pullback in cloud customer spending due to a weakened economy, but it once again showed the resilience of its diverse business model, heavily investing into its growth on the AI front. During the first half of the year, it was pivoting different parts of its business to AI as it aimed to get ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) offerings. Interestingly, Amazon aims to distinguish itself in the AI field by going into the hardware side of AI by developing AI-specific chips. With its in-house chips, Amazon promises to offer the best price to performance ratio in the industry.
Nvidia Is Running The AI Chip Show, But Its Peers Are Determined To Power The AI Revolution
Although Nvidia has emerged as the leader whose chips powered the early days of the AI revolution, both big and small rivals are rising to the challenge with Advance Micro Devices and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) are determined to catch up, with Microsoft and Amazon potentially changing the rules of the game entirely. Export restrictions and an intensifying technology war between China and the U.S. can also play a big part in reshaping the AI chip landscape.

Musk Says Tesla to Spend Over $1 Billion on Dojo Supercomputer
Condor Galaxy 1, located in Santa Clara, California, is now up and running, according to Cerebras founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman. The supercomputer, which cost more than $100 million, is going to double in size “in the coming weeks,” he said. It will be followed by new systems in Austin and Asheville, North Carolina, in the first half of next year, with overseas sites going online in the second half of 2024.
The project is part of a dash to add computing power for AI services, which require the kind of heavy-duty processing that’s become a specialty of Nvidia — the world’s most valuable chipmaker. The Cerebras machinery, which Feldman describes as the biggest purpose-built AI computing center, is an attempt to satisfy that need with a novel approach.
It also marks a deeper push into the field by the United Arab Emirates, which is betting on next-generation technology with a firm called Group 42, or G42. The company is focused on pushing artificial research toward practical uses in areas such as aviation and health care.
The new supercomputers will be operated by Cerebras and used for G42 projects. Any excess capacity will offered commercially as a service.
For Cerebras, based in Silicon Valley, the new systems provide a showcase that it hopes will lead to wider adoption. The company’s offerings rely on massive chips that are made out of whole silicon wafers — disks that are normally sliced up to create multiple components.

Feldman argues that his processors have the advantage of being able to deal with large data sets in one go, rather than only working on portions of the information at a time. Compared with Nvidia’s processors, they also require less of the complicated software needed to make chips work in concert, he said.
This year, cloud computing providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS have been stocking up on Nvidia processors to keep up with runaway demand for OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. Nvidia has about 80% of the market for the so-called accelerators that help handle these workloads.
With his computing rollout, Feldman aims to demonstrate that the AI explosion won’t just benefit the giant tech companies that can afford big-budget equipment.
“There is a misconception that there are only seven to 10 companies in the world that could buy at scale to make a difference,” he said. “This vastly changes the conversation.”
Feldman’s processors are so large they won’t fit in traditional machinery, leading Cerebras to offer its technology in specially built computers. The machines also rely on standard processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — the company that bought Feldman’s previous startup, SeaMicro Inc.
One of the new supercomputers will be capable of training software on data sets made up of 600 billion variables, with the ability to increase that to 100 trillion, Cerebras said. Each one will be comprised of 54 million AI-optimized computing cores.

(Reuters) - Cerebras Systems on Thursday said that it has signed an approximately $100 million deal to supply the first of three artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers to the United Arab Emirates-based technology group G42.
The deal comes as cloud computing providers around the world are searching for alternatives to chips from Nvidia Corp, the market leader in AI computing whose products are in short supply, thanks to the surging popularity of ChatGPT and other services. Cerebras is one of several startups looking to challenge Nvidia.
Silicon Valley-based Cerebras said that G42 has agreed to purchase three of what it calls its Condor Galaxy systems, all of which it will build in the U.S. to speed up the roll out. The first one will come online this year, with two more coming in early 2024.
Abu Dhabi-based G42, a tech conglomerate with nine operating companies that include datacenter and cloud service businesses, says it plans to use the Cerebras systems to sell AI computing services to health care and energy companies. G42 has raised $800 million from U.S. tech investment firm Silver Lake, which has backing from Mudabala, the UAE's soverign wealth fund.
""Cerebras has what they call a 'white glove' service that made it easy for us"" to build AI systems on its machines, G42 Cloud CEO Talal AlKaissi told Reuters.
""There will be some excess capacity that we hope to wholesale with Cerebras to customers in the open-source AI community from many places around the world, especially in the U.S. ecosystem.""
The contract to complete the first of the three systems announced on Thursday is worth about $100 million, Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said.
""What we're saying is that the $100 million contract takes us through Condor Galaxy 1... That's the unit, the building block.""
G42 Cloud's AlKaissi declined to comment on the terms of the deal.

As Insider reported, combined, the companies gained as much as $192 billion in market capitalization during July 18’s intraday trading. Microsoft and Nvidia ended the day with respective increases of $102 billion and $26 billion.
As of July 20, shares of Microsoft are up 48% year-to-date, while shares of Nvidia are up an eye-popping 229%.
Musk is known for commenting on stocks and companies, but whether this is a warning on how they will be faring is another story. Musk himself has benefited from the AI-driven tech bull market, as shares of Tesla are up 170% year-to-date.
The gain in Microsoft and Nvidia market capitalizations reflects high investor expectations for how much these tech giants will benefit from the coming boom in generative AI, said Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.
“Musk’s red flag comments are a sign that he is behind in the race to capitalize on generative AI. To be sure, at some point there will be a reckoning for all the high valuations for generative AI companies. But to walk away now, investors would be giving up tremendous upside in the years ahead,” Cohan said.
Tesla reported earnings on July 19, beating analyst estimates. Yet, during the earnings call, Musk’s comments about the economy being in “turbulent times” sent the stock down.
“One day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart and the next day, everything is fine. I don’t know what’s going on. It’d be totally fine. I wish I did. So, I mean that’s why I say like I was on Twitter, I posted like just really advising because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones that have stuck with us through thick and thin,” he added, according to a transcript of the call.

Where Will AI and Tech Stocks Go For the Rest of the Year?
In terms of where tech stocks will be heading in the second half of the year, several experts see a continued bull market driven by AI.
“There will be winners and losers in tech, but ultimately we see a strong 2H ahead for the tech sector with a new tech bull market underway heading into a June earnings season that should bring more optimism into Street forecasts for the rest of FY23/FY24,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives stated in a clients note.
Ives added that while both Microsoft and Nvidia are at the top, “this battle will be a long one over the next decade.”
“We expect other technology companies besides Google, such as Oracle, Amazon, Salesforce, Palantir, MongoDB, Apple, IBM, Meta, Adobe, Snowflake, C3.ai, and other tech stalwarts along with smaller players in the industry, to collectively spend tens of billions in this AI arms race in 2023/2024.”

NVDA,2023-07-20 17:46:20,Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company is using a large amount of Nvidia hardware to power its AI tools.,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday said the company is using so much Nvidia (NVDA) hardware to power its self-driving training systems, the chipmaker can’t keep up with its demand. Musk Tesla’s massive need for high-powered Nvidia chips during Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, during which he discussed the company’s custom-built supercomputer.
“We’re using a lot of Nvidia hardware,” Musk said during the earnings call. “We’ll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for [CEO] Jensen [Huange] and Nvidia. They’ve done an incredible job.”
Shares of both Nvidia and Tesla were down 2% and 7%, respectively, Wednesday along with the rest of the broader market and tech sector.
According to Musk, Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla’s orders, Nvidia can’t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires.
Tesla has worked with Nvidia for years, and the electric automaker already runs a Nvidia-powered supercomputer. But because of the boom in AI, demand for Nvidia’s chips is pressuring customers like Tesla.
To address this, Musk says Tesla is building its own supercomputer, called Dojo, that runs on custom silicon. The company says its beginning construction of the machine this month.
“If [Nvidia] could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can’t,” Musk said.
Nvidia is benefiting handsomely from the AI boom, and its growth is unlikely to slow anytime soon. Tesla’s need for Nvidia, and its own hardware, also points to the wide breadth of the AI market and variety of use cases which range from Musk’s pursuit of self-driving vehicles to smart home systems.
The current explosive interest in AI kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot in Nov. 2022. One of the fastest growing apps in history, ChatGPT jump started a generative AI revolution. Microsoft (MSFT), which is investing billions in OpenAI, used the company’s technology in its Bing chatbot and Edge web browser it launched in February.
Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed that news with its own AI announcements during its Google I/O conference in May. Meta (META) is already working on its own generative AI capabilities, and according to Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) is also developing its version of the technology.
Shares of Microsoft and Alphabet are up 45% and 36%, respectively, year to date. Nvidia’s shares are up a whopping 214% thanks in part to the fact that it’s the market leader in AI chips that companies need to train and operate their AI platforms.
During its first quarter earnings report, Nvidia issued second quarter guidance that blew away Wall Street’s expectations. The company says it will bring in $11 billion in revenue in the current quarter plus or minus 2%. Wall Street anticipated $7.2 billion.
We’ll see if it meets or exceeds those expectations when the company reports its earnings on Aug. 23.

Satya Nadella's haul means he joins an elite club of corporate CEOs that includes Tim Cook.
Microsoft has gone from strength to strength amid the AI boom – and it's helped push CEO Satya Nadella's total payouts from the company to $1 billion.
According to regulatory filings cited by Bloomberg, that's what his equity grants, salary, bonuses and dividends all add up to since he took the job in early 2014.
As an example, Nadella's total compensation was about $55 million in 2022, including a $2.5 million salary, $10 million in cash incentives, and $42 million in stock awards, according to Microsoft's latest proxy statement.
But it's the near-1,000% rise in the company's share price since he became CEO that's largely behind the surge.
Microsoft recently added $154 billion to its market cap in a day after it announced a $30 AI subscription for its Office 365 platform. That's equivalent to the entire net worth of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

What a UPS Strike Would Mean for Consumers, Businesses and the Economy
Condor Galaxy 1, located in Santa Clara, California, is now up and running, according to Cerebras founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman. The supercomputer, which cost more than $100 million, is going to double in size “in the coming weeks,” he said. It will be followed by new systems in Austin and Asheville, North Carolina, in the first half of next year, with overseas sites going online in the second half of 2024.
The project is part of a dash to add computing power for AI services, which require the kind of heavy-duty processing that’s become a specialty of Nvidia — the world’s most valuable chipmaker. The Cerebras machinery, which Feldman describes as the biggest purpose-built AI computing center, is an attempt to satisfy that need with a novel approach.
It also marks a deeper push into the field by the United Arab Emirates, which is betting on next-generation technology with a firm called Group 42, or G42. The company is focused on pushing artificial research toward practical uses in areas such as aviation and health care.
The new supercomputers will be operated by Cerebras and used for G42 projects. Any excess capacity will offered commercially as a service.
“Abu Dhabi was the first nation to have minister for AI. They have a university for AI,” said Feldman. “They believe that this is a transformative technology for their economy.”
For Cerebras, based in Silicon Valley, the new systems provide a showcase that it hopes will lead to wider adoption. The company’s offerings rely on massive chips that are made out of whole silicon wafers — disks that are normally sliced up to create multiple components.

Feldman argues that his processors have the advantage of being able to deal with large data sets in one go, rather than only working on portions of the information at a time. Compared with Nvidia’s processors, they also require less of the complicated software needed to make chips work in concert, he said.
This year, cloud computing providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS have been stocking up on Nvidia processors to keep up with runaway demand for OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. Nvidia has about 80% of the market for the so-called accelerators that help handle these workloads.
With his computing rollout, Feldman aims to demonstrate that the AI explosion won’t just benefit the giant tech companies that can afford big-budget equipment.
“There is a misconception that there are only seven to 10 companies in the world that could buy at scale to make a difference,” he said. “This vastly changes the conversation.”
Feldman’s processors are so large they won’t fit in traditional machinery, leading Cerebras to offer its technology in specially built computers. The machines also rely on standard processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — the company that bought Feldman’s previous startup, SeaMicro Inc.
One of the new supercomputers will be capable of training software on data sets made up of 600 billion variables, with the ability to increase that to 100 trillion, Cerebras said. Each one will be comprised of 54 million AI-optimized computing cores.

But not everyone has had the same luck.
The cofounder of artificial-intelligence startup Stability AI took a massive notional loss — when he dumped his 15% stake for a mere $100 just months before the company hit a $1 billion valuation.
And he hasn't taken it lightly.
Cyrus Hodes has struck legal action against Stability AI's CEO Mohammad Emad Mostaque and the company this month, arguing he was tricked into thinking his stake in the generative AI company was ""worthless.""
""Specifically, in October 2021 and May 2022, Mostaque purchased from Hodes his entire 15% stake in Stability AI for only $100.00, having led Hodes to believe that the company he had helped build was essentially worthless,"" the lawsuit said.
""But just a few months later, in August 2022, the company engaged in a seed funding round in which venture capital firms invested $101 million at a post-money valuation of $1 billion,"" he added.
""More recently, the company has been in the marketplace seeking funding at a valuation of $4 billion. At that valuation, the shares that Mostaque purchased from Hodes for a mere $100.00 would have a market value of over half a billion dollars (on an undiluted basis),"" according to the lawsuit.
The suit is ""without merit"" and Stability AI will ""aggressively defend our position,"" the company said in emailed comments.
Stability AI, which is known for developing the open-source, text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, was founded in 2020 and quickly rose to fame for its text-to-image product. It's also been riding the high wave amid the recent investor frenzy over artificial intelligence, but Mostaque has shut down the hype, predicting AI will be ""biggest bubble of all time.""

Nadella’s Microsoft Payouts Top $1 Billion on 1,000% Stock Boom
The main chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. slid as much as 3.8% during early trading in Taipei after projecting a 10% fall in sales this year, versus previous guidance for a single-digit decline. Shares in chip firms Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV, TSMC’s primary gear suppliers, slid in Europe and Asia. Memory chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. also fell in Seoul, while Nvidia declined more than 3% in the US.
The delay in the US — a consequence of a lack of skilled American workers and ballooning costs — underscores the difficulties in making chips there as Washington strives to reduce a global reliance on Asian-based supply.
TSMC’s surprise cut in 2023 revenue projections suggests a post-Covid electronics slump may persist, offsetting a surge in demand for high-end chips for AI development. Executives warned investors on Thursday to temper their expectations on that front, saying it was uncertain if that upswell was sustainable. TSMC’s market value had climbed close to 30% this year, before Friday’s slide.
“This is the third cut to its revenue outlook that TSMC has made this cycle,” Needham analysts wrote in a research note. That “may disappoint some bulls, but we see the lack of inventory rebuild through year-end will set up the company for strong growth in 2024.”
TSMC Falls on Guide, Analysts Positive on Long Term: Street Wrap
TSMC delivered the outlook after posting its first quarterly profit decline in four years, underscoring the extent of a global slide in smartphone and PC demand. It reported a 23% slide in net income to NT$181.8 billion ($5.85 billion). Executives said capital intensity — a measure of the pace at which TSMC buys or invests in capital equipment — will slow in coming years.
Executives on Thursday said they were also pushing back the anticipated start of output from its new Arizona plant to 2025. President Joe Biden’s administration has made development of domestic chip production a top strategic priority, backed by subsidies in the Chips and Science Act that may top $50 billion. As the US clashes with China, American politicians have been concerned about the vulnerability of Taiwan, which Beijing has claimed as its own territory.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
TSMC’s lower sales target for 2023 suggests a deeper-than-expected downturn in smartphone chips and end-market handset demand, aggravated by worsening macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China. Despite a surge in N3 node orders for Apple’s new line of iPhones and an uptick in AI chip-related production, TSMC projects full-year sales will drop by 10%, double its guided 5% decline in April.

To mitigate concerns from customers over geopolitical uncertainties in the Taiwan Strait, TSMC has been diversifying its manufacturing footprint. It is investing $40 billion to create two fabs in Arizona and constructing a $8.6 billion facility in Japan with financial support from the government. The company remains in discussions with Tokyo over subsidies for a second facility, which might be located alongside its current plant in Kumamoto.
The hiccups in Arizona however call into question whether TSMC can make chips abroad as efficiently as back home.
“We are working on improving this by sending skilled technical workers from Taiwan to the US,” TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said.

Bitcoin has rallied 79% this year to about $29,800, but has slid by 5% over the past seven days, per CoinMarketCap. Ether, Cardano's ADA, and Solana's SOL tokens have also rebounded strongly in 2023, but declined between 5% and 11% in the past week.
Meanwhile, investors have piled into AI stocks this year, as they expect the tech to boost productivity and bolster providers' profits. For example, Nvidia shares have more than tripled, boosting the graphics-chip maker's market capitalization to about $1.2 trillion.
Tesla has more than doubled in value too, as CEO Elon Musk continues to promise self-driving cars and humanoid robots to his investors. Microsoft's stock price has also surged by 45% to a record high, in part because it invested $10 billion in ChatGPT-parent OpenAI earlier this year.
Taleb, a former hedge fund manager, has repeatedly dismissed crypto as an investment. He's described bitcoin as a ""cult,"" argued it fails as a haven asset or useful medium of exchange, and joked it's not even good for money laundering because bitcoin transactions are traceable.
However, Taleb also warned in February that stocks were hugely overvalued relative to interest rates, which have jumped from nearly zero to north of 5% since early last year.

Nvidia and Tesla dipped 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively, while Alphabet added nearly 1% and Apple and Amazon were near unchanged.
Before trading begins on Monday, exchange operator Nasdaq will trim the weight of a handful of companies that make up close to half of the Nasdaq 100.
Nasdaq describes the Nasdaq 100 as a ""modified market capitalization-weighted index,"" with company weights depending on their stock market value, while also applying rules to limit the influence of the largest stocks in the index.
The Nasdaq 100 includes 100 of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange, and changes to the index will force investment funds that track it to adjust their portfolios and sell shares of companies that have their weight in the index reduced.
""We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day's average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day's volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a client note on Monday.
Broadcom, which will likely see its weight increase in the Nasdaq 100 following the rebalance, rose 1.6%. The chipmaker currently makes up 2.4% of the index, according to Refinitiv data.
Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla have been among the biggest winners in the U.S. stock market's recovery this year, increasing their combined influence in the Nasdaq 100. That has helped the Nasdaq 100 surge 42% in 2023, compared to a 25% increase in the Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index.
The Nasdaq 100 was near flat on Friday.
Nasdaq announced its plan to rebalance the index on July 7.
A special rebalance may be triggered if the aggregate weight of companies individually accounting for more than 4.5% of the index tops 48%, according to Nasdaq.

Stocks opened comfortably higher Friday, but lost steam as the session wore on. Amid an empty economic calendar, attention was focused on the latest batch of earnings reports and a continued win streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
American Express (AXP) was one of the most notable earnings movers today, with the Dow stock slumping 3.9% after its Q2 results. Drilling down on the numbers, the credit card company reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.89 per share, though revenue of $15.1 billion fell short of estimates.
Particularly noteworthy were comments from American Express CEO Steve Squeri, who said in the company's earnings call that ""cardmembers' spending hit another all-time high in the quarter."" Translation: The consumer remains resilient even as the Federal Reserve tries to bring down inflation by slowing the economy.
CSX (CSX) was another post-earning decliner, with the industrial stock falling 3.7% after its quarterly report. The railroad operator said both earnings and revenue were down on a year-over-year basis in its second quarter, though the 49 cents per share and $3.7 billion it reported matched analysts' estimates.
Tech stocks decline ahead of Nasdaq-100 rebalancing
Meanwhile, several tech stocks including Apple (AAPL, -0.6%) and Nvidia (NVDA, -2.7%) declined ahead of Monday's major rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq offshoot tracks 100 of the largest and most actively traded non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. This year's mega-cap tech rally has resulted in oversized weightings in a handful of stocks, and the rebalancing is needed to bring them back in line with the index's methodology.
A special Nasdaq-100 rebalancing is rare and last occurred in 2011, says David Kostin, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Apple and Microsoft (MSFT, -0.9%) will have the biggest reductions in weightings, Kostin adds, while semiconductor stock Broadcom (AVGO, +1.0%) will see the largest increase.
At the close, the Dow was up marginally at 35,227, eking out a 10th straight win. The S&P 500 also finished with a fractional gain at 4,536, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2% to 14,032.
Big Tech earnings, Fed meeting on deck
So what's in store for next week? It will be a busy one, that's for sure. A jam-packed earnings calendar will certainly keep investors on their toes, particularly as Big Tech results start to roll in. Among the many notable names set to report is Microsoft, which has been one of the best AI stocks so far this year.
Additionally, the next Fed meeting will kick off Tuesday, with the central bank's monetary policy announcement due out Wednesday afternoon. Futures traders are pricing in a 99.8% chance the Fed will hike interest rates by a quarter-percentage point next week, according to CME Group, so all eyes will be looking for hints as to whether this will be the end of rate hikes – or if another is expected later this year.
In his press conference, which will occur after the policy statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""is likely to emphasize that further evidence is needed to have confidence inflation will be tamed,"" and that more tightening is needed, says Matthew Luzzetti, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. However, with the July and August consumer price index (CPI) and jobs reports due out between now and the September Fed meeting, Powell is unlikely to give strong guidance on the potential for more rate hikes. ""Data dependency will remain a key theme for the Chair,"" Luzzetti says.

AMC Shares Surge as Judge Denies APE Deal in Surprise Ruling
During meetings in Washington on Monday, Intel Corp.’s Pat Gelsinger, Nvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang and Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon warned that export controls risk harming US leadership of the industry. The Biden officials listened to the presentations but didn’t make any commitments, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private.
The chip industry is trying to navigate increasing tensions between China and the US. Companies are being forced to curb shipments to their largest market by Washington, which has cited national security concerns about the Asian nation acquiring certain capabilities. One of the executives against current rules restricting the export of artificial intelligence hardware to China, saying the policy hasn’t achieved the intended outcome of slowing China’s AI development.
The Biden team has been exploring ways to further tighten existing curbs — for example, by targeting chips made by Nvidia specifically for the China market, according to people familiar with the matter. In addition to the US restrictions, US chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc. have faced actions by Beijing that have hurt their ability to do business in the country.
Representatives for the three companies declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the National Security Council.
US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Friday he agreed with the executives that the approach needs to be a “small yard, high fence” — effective but limited. He defended the administration’s actions to date as just that, saying the measures were targeted and had virtually no impact on US-China trade for most chips.
“The vast majority of sales of chips designed by the United States to China has continued unabated,” he said at the Aspen Security Forum. “It continues to this day.”
He hinted that more curbs could follow but that they would only be implemented after robust discussion with the affected companies.
“We are going to continue to look at very targeted, very specific restrictions on technology with national security and military applications and make judgments rigorously, carefully, methodically — and, yes, in deep consultation with our private sector,” he said.
During the discussion on Monday, Intel’s Gelsinger told Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other officials that further restricting what his company does in China puts at risk a key Biden policy of bringing back chip production to the US, the people said.
Without orders from Chinese customers, there will be much less need to go ahead with projects such as Intel’s planned factory complex in Ohio, the executive said, according to the people. Nvidia’s Huang said that limiting sales of some of his chips in China had merely made alternatives more popular.

Overall, the executives argued that while Chinese customers have been forced to buy more chips to do the work of banned products, that hasn’t significantly slowed them down. The availability and quality of software they’re using more than compensates for any hardware restrictions, they argued.
Gelsinger, who also spoke at the Aspen Security Forum, mentioned the meetings in Washington during his appearance on Wednesday.
“We did communicate a very important message on China,” he said. “Right now, China represents 25% to 30% of semiconductor exports. If I have 20% or 30% less market, I need to build less factories.”
It’s in the interest of the US to allow its chip companies access to the Chinese market in general because revenue from that country helps fuel research and development, he argued. And that’s needed to keep the nation’s lead in new technology such as quantum computing.
Qualcomm gets more than 60% of its revenue from the China region, where it supplies components to smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. Gelsinger, who visited Beijing earlier this month to show off his company’s latest AI chips, counts the nation as Intel’s biggest sales region — with China providing about a quarter of its revenue. For Nvidia, China provides about a fifth of sales.
So far, chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc. have taken the biggest hits to revenue, being forced to knock billions of dollars off their projections. But the restrictions, which companies fear will be extended to other classes of chips, are also affecting some device makers.

Oil Trader Vitol Doubled Average Pay on Record $15.1 Billion Profit
Hardware makers Wistron Corp., its affiliate Wiwynn Corp. and Quanta Computer Inc. jumped to record highs on Monday following recent upgrades by banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Analysts said these firms will benefit from the rise in AI server adoption by hyper-scalers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the US.
Tech original design manufacturers have long been overlooked by investors due to the lack of growth catalysts despite their relatively stable earnings and high cash payouts, Citi said. But investors have become increasingly bullish on these stocks in the face of an intensifying AI arms race.
“There’s still room for these shares to go higher, as we are still in the early innings of the paradigm shift brought about by generative AI,” Citi analysts wrote in a note on July 19.
Taiwanese hardware firms produce parts for computer servers and supply to some of the world’s biggest tech companies including Google and Apple Inc., according to Bloomberg-compiled data. A huge sales forecast last quarter by Nvidia Corp. may also translate to positive earnings trend for their suppliers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and those who build servers using Nvidia’s chips.
BofA Global Research in a July 14 note said Taiwan tech was the fund’s largest overweight in Asia Pacific, along with India financials.
Still, some analysts cautioned that gains in tech stocks are increasingly sentiment-driven.
“The share price rally could have reached a point where investors may start to wonder if AI’s contributions to these stocks actually deserve all the valuation hypes,” said Steven Tseng, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Investors should take note on “how concrete each stock’s AI story is,” he said. “Those companies with good exposures in AI server supply chain may sustain better than others.”

Three months ago, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and others battled for AI mentions and saw stocks pop on promises for future earnings. This quarter, investors will be more keen on hearing about the timing by which those promises can be delivered.
""Everybody can talk the marketing spin, but I need to see some tangible impacts on the P&L,"" Paul Meeks, Independent Solutions Wealth Management portfolio manager, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""You better give that to me. At least guide to it for the next couple of quarters because I'm going to start to believe that it's all smoke.""
Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are all expected to report earnings this week and provide updates on their plans for AI after buzz over the technology sent their stocks soaring through the first half of 2023.
ChatGPT sparked the AI conversation with its launch last November, and Microsoft and Alphabet quickly advanced the conversation with their plans for how the technology could reinvent search. Then, when the companies reported first quarter earnings in the spring,AI exuberance fully took hold.
Microsoft mentioned AI more than 50 times on its earnings call. Google called it out more than 100 times at an event in May. Even Coca-Cola said it was ""exploring ways to leverage AI.""
Nvidia's AI callout proved to be the most monumental. The chipmaker noted the technology could boost the next quarter's earnings by roughly 50% more than initially anticipated.
That sent tech stocks soaring higher, and AI became a common refrain in research notes as strategists boosted their full-year outlooks for the S&P 500.
""We think investors' enthusiasm about AI has room to grow even further over the next couple of years,"" Capital Economics senior markets economist Thomas Mathews wrote in June.
A recent check of AI hype shows Mathews's take is still on point. Last week, a Bloomberg report about Apple working on its own form of ChatGPT sent the stock up about 1%. A day before, Microsoft shares rose about 4% as the company announced pricing for its M365 Copilot AI product. Both stocks finished at all-time highs on the day the developments broke.
In a Microsoft earnings preview that included a price target boost to $400 from $350 due to the tech giant's latest AI innovation, Goldman Sachs managing director Kash Rangan wrote how much companies attribute growth to AI will be in focus.
""After a year of downward estimate revisions, we see investors being particularly receptive should Microsoft guide to a solid double-digit revenue clip in FY24,"" Rangan wrote on July 21. ""We expect the level of attribution management will credit to Gen-AI to be of particular focus as the market looks to validate the spending curve of this innovation cycle.""
But questions are still swirling around whether technology stocks have been overbid amid the AI craze. Early tech earnings reports last week showed investors were quick to dump tech stocks if the earnings announcements didn't have the right mix.
Both Tesla and Netflix fell nearly 10% in the day following their earnings reports as investors focused on Tesla's shrinking margins and Netflix's revenue coming in weaker than expected.
""This may be telling as to how high the bar really is to support current valuations,""Citigroup managing director Scott Chronert wrote in a note on Friday. ""Next week we may need to see strength across line items and a guidance lift to maintain index-level momentum.""

In the third quarter so far, those stocks account for 6% of the index's growth.
That's as non-tech sectors are growing more prominent, with financials in the lead.
Big Tech's hold on the S&P 500 is finally loosening, as other sectors strengthen their presence on the index, according to Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.
While those stocks accounted for virtually all the S&P 500's gains at the start of the year, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta have contributed less towards the index's returns since then.
""The rest of the US equity market is finally catching up, which is great, but that means Q3 gains may not be as robust as Q2 unless Big Tech has another leg higher,"" Colas said in a Monday note.
Following first-quarter strength, bullish investors continued to rally around these firms, given excitement over artificial intelligence utilized by these companies. In the second quarter, Big Tech was responsible for 73% of S&P 500 gains, Colas wrote.
However, this ratio has already fallen to 6% so far in July, as other sectors make their way into the market spotlight.
Financials led the rally of non-Big Tech, accounting for 32% of S&P 500 returns so far this quarter. Though the note highlights this sector as best positioned for near-term gains, the index is further boosted by health care, industrials, energy, consumer staples, utilities, and real estate.
However, DataTrek also notes that these sectors are not gaining on fundamental performance — especially as non-Big Tech earnings expectations trend downwards — but on bets on a valuation expansion.
""Hope for an end to Fed rate hikes while the US economy is still growing is the reason for the current rally. This underpins market confidence in near term earnings stability and eventual growth off a still-high base of corporate margins,"" Colas wrote.
Meanwhile, investors can gear up for some guidance from Big Tech this week, as Alphabet and Microsoft publish earnings on Tuesday, followed by Meta's Wednesday report.","The S&P 500 is moving on from its Big Tech fixation, but that could mean smaller 3rd-quarter gains",443.09,446.12,456.79001,7,2023,24

If you want to see more stocks in his portfolio, check out Top 5 Stocks in Lee Ainslie’s Portfolio.
Lee Ainslie is the face and the brains behind Maverick Capital, a high-profile hedge fund with a net worth of about $4 billion. Founded in 1993, the hedge fund primarily invests in stocks while staying clear of bonds, commodities, currencies, and options. Some of its notable holdings are in tech giants, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have helped reinvigorate the hedge fund's fortunes in recent months.
Ainslie's bio is one that speaks volumes in addition to being the managing partner of Maverick Capital. Before founding the hedge fund in 1993, he was the managing director of Tiger Management. He also serves on the boards of Robin Hood Foundation and the Economic Club of New York. Lee Ainslie wife is Elizabeth Ainslie.
The father of two, Ainslie has made a name for himself as a pure long/short equity investor. He primarily focuses on stocks he thinks will beat the market and sells those he thinks will underperform. Over the years, the hedge fund manager has beaten the S&P 500 by 6% to 7% percentage points with 50% less volatility. Lee Ainslie net worth of over $1B stems from stellar performance of Maverick Capital hedge fund with bets on Salesforce Facebook and Meta all of which have exploded in 2023.
However, Ainslie had a first quarter to forget as Maverick Capital fell into the red, losing 22.9% compared to a 4.6% gain of the S&P 500. One key factor behind the massive loss is the hedge fund's significant holding in Coupang, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the losses. The hedge fund's fortunes were also hurt by its biotech stocks holdings that remained under pressure.
According to Ainslie, a decline in dollar volume M&A activity in the biotech sector hurt the segment as the impact of discount rates on valuation multiple also fueled the weakness. Fast forward, the hedge fund appears to have found its footing thanks to Ainslie's solid stock picks, especially in the tech space.
Investments in Amazon, Nvidia, Netflix, and Microsoft should help offset losses in other sectors as the tech stocks have posted double-digit gains amid the AI boom. In addition to betting big on tech giants, Ainslie is going short on housing and durable stocks as he does not expect spending on home improvements or furnishing to assume growth to the elevated levels recorded in 2021.
In addition to shorting housing and durable stocks, Ainslie initiated a new position in Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) in the first quarter of 2022, a high-quality, high-growth company on the right side of changes in healthcare. According to Ainslie, Masimo is a clear leader in pulse oximetry, a duopoly segment with contracts running five to seven years. Masimo products outperform those of its peers, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower patient costs. Therefore, the company boasts a solid recurring revenue base of 80% with an average customer retention rate of 98%.
In Q1 2023, Maverick Capital's portfolio value declined from $4.22 billion to $3.95 billion. The fund added 194 new stocks, boosted its holdings in 157 stocks, sold off 122 stocks, and reduced its exposure in 94 stocks.

NVDA,2023-07-25 11:27:15,Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh expects the company to generate $25 billion to $30 billion in AI revenues this year.,"Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said Nvidia's share price has another 20% upside to run on the AI boom.
He added the chipmaker could generate $300 billion in AI-specific revenue by 2027.
The stock has already doubled so far this year and is trading around $446 apiece.
Chipmaker Nvidia's having a great year with its stock price doubling amid the artificial intelligence, or AI hype — and it could get even better.
Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh has given Nvidia's stock price another 20% upside to run — and even this new target of $530 is ""conservative,"" according to a Sunday client note seen by Insider. Rakesh's previous price target for Nvidia was $400.
Nvidia shares closed 0.7% higher at $446.12 apiece on Monday. The stock has surged 205% so far this year.
He also expects Nvidia to maintain its dominant position in AI chips till at least 2027. The company could generate around $300 billion in AI-specific revenue by 2027 with a 75% market share of AI server units, Rakesh added. That's 10 times his projection of $25 billion to $30 billion in AI revenues this year, he told Dow Jones on Monday.
""With demand for generative AI accelerating, we see significant opportunities for hardware suppliers powering the higher compute needs for large-language models, particularly AI powerhouse NVDA,"" Rakesh wrote, referring to the Santa Clara-based chipmaker by its stock symbol.
Rakesh's endorsement of Nvidia followed the company's blockbuster first-quarter results from the generative artificial intelligence boom that was posted in May.
Consequently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's wealth has also nearly doubled this year, per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is now the 32nd richest person in the world with a net worth of $40 billion — up 189% so far this year.
Huang owns 86.9 million Nvidia shares, or about 3.5% of the Santa Clara-based chipmaker, per the company's 2023 annual report.
Mizuho's Rakesh is not the only analyst bullish on Nvidia. In June, Morgan Stanley called Nvidia its ""top pick"" on the back of demand for its AI chips.","Nvidia could mint $300 billion in AI revenues by 2027, 10 times the expected takings this year, analyst says",446.12,456.79001,454.51999,7,2023,25
NVDA,2023-07-25 20:58:46,"Stocks are being supported by AI mania and market momentum, but threatened by worrying economic data and indicators, Bill gross said.","Bill Gross expects the stock market to slump once the economy cools and saps investor enthusiasm.
The ""Bond King"" expects slowdowns in the US and China to dampen the buzz around AI and stocks.
Several experts no longer anticipate a recession, while others continue to predict a slowdown.
Stocks are set to retreat once two bruising headwinds pummel bullish investors into submission, Bill Gross says.
""Exciting doubles match currently in stock market,"" the billionaire investor tweeted on Monday. ""AI and market momentum vs China/US slowdown and negative curve persisting. I pick the latter.""
Gross is known as the ""Bond King"" as he cofounded fixed-income juggernaut PIMCO and managed its flagship bond fund. Based on his tweet, he believes economic downturns in the US and China, and the inverted yield curve, will overpower the current hype around artificial intelligence and faith in the ongoing market rally, sending stocks downward.
Investors are betting aggressively that AI will supercharge productivity and supersize corporate profits. They've piled into the stocks likely to benefit from a boom, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms.
The tech-stock rally has widened in recent weeks to include more staid companies such as Walmart, up 10% this year, and Lowe's, up 18%. The market's climb also reflects improved economic sentiment; inflation has cooled from a 40-year high of 9.1% to 3% over the last 12 months, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates and avoid a recession.
However, China's economy only expanded by 0.8% over the last three months, down from 2.2% in the first quarter. The slowdown surprised analysts who expected the country's lifting of pandemic restrictions would unleash rapid growth.
Alarms are flashing in the US too. The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index fell for a 15th straight month in June, suggesting a contraction is in the cards. Consumer savings, retail spending, and industries such as commercial real estate all appear to be under pressure as well.
Moreover, a negative or inverted yield curve has been a reliable recession indicator for decades. When returns from short-term bonds exceed those from long-term bonds, it signals that investors expect the Fed to meaningfully cut rates, which it typically does to stimulate a beleaguered economy.
Gross' view appears to be that the economy will slump, investors' enthusiasm toward AI and the wider market will falter, and stocks will decline. Other experts including David Rosenberg have issued similar warnings, while the likes of Paul Krugman no longer expect a recession.",'Bond King' Bill Gross predicts stocks will drop as US and China slowdowns overshadow AI hype,446.12,456.79001,454.51999,7,2023,25
NVDA,2023-07-26 00:43:47,"""My definition of a bubble is... when your neighbor is making money on a stock [and you are not],"" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said.","An AI-driven stock market bubble has not yet formed, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.
Lee compared the performance of Cisco during the dot-com bubble to Nvidia today to make his point.
There are three reasons that suggest there is not yet a stock market bubble fueled by the AI hype.
Think there's a bubble in the stock market fueled by hype surrounding artificial intelligence?
Think again, says Fundstrat's Tom Lee.
In a video to clients on Monday, Lee outlined three reasons why the stock market has yet to enter a bubble.
To make his point, Lee compared the price action of Nvidia stock today to Cisco during the 2000 dot-com bubble. The comparison makes sense given that Nvidia is seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, while Cisco was the poster child of the dot-com bubble thanks to its suite of networking products during the internet boom.
From 1990 to 1997, $100 invested in Cisco stock turned into $11,500. That may sound like a bubble to most people, but what happened next defied everyone's expectations.
That same $100 invested in Cisco ultimately turned into $103,000 at its peak in March 2000, representing a gain of as much as 102,900%.
Now, fast forward to the recent price action of Nvidia, which over the same multi-year period turned $100 into about $8,865. For a true bubble to form, Nvidia would have to soar much higher from current levels, even after the stock's 323% gain from its mid-October low.
""My question to you is this: If AI is about to be a bubble, I think you should be aware that a 1999 bubble is a more than ten times increase coming, so be aware,"" Lee said.
Other reasons Lee doesn't believe a true bubble has formed in the stock market is the fact that six of the eight mega-cap tech stocks are still trading below their all-time highs. And while Apple is trading at record highs, the stock is just 5% above its previous all-time high.
""How do you get a bubble when they're [mega-cap tech stocks] not even at all time highs?"" Lee asked.
Finally, fund flows have overwhelmingly illustrated an investor that is actually scared of stocks, not enthusiastic about them, according to Lee. Since the end of last year, cumulative fund flows have shown investors pour $723.5 million into money market funds and $145.6 million into bonds, while investors pulled $115.1 million out of stocks.
""Can it be a bubble when there's outflows out of equities? I don't think so,"" Lee said.
Ultimately, there's no real definition of a stock market bubble, according to Lee, and a lot of the meaning behind it is more of a psychological feeling for investors.
""There's not a real definition of a bubble... My definition of a bubble is... when your neighbor is making money on a stock [and you are not],"" Lee said. ""I do think it's very subjective.""",Think there's an AI bubble in the stock market? Think again.,456.79001,454.51999,459.0,7,2023,26

The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence
The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has revolutionized almost every industry and sector in the market today, and the technology sector is perhaps the most heavily impacted by this frenzy. Semiconductor companies, in particular, are well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, with many companies reporting higher sales and revenue forecasts directly correlated with the developments being seen in this space today. One example is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which forecasted its second-quarter revenue to come in at $11 billion, going above analyst estimates. Jensen Huang, the founder, and CEO of the company, noted that they will be increasing the supply of their family of products to meet the rising demand for them.
On May 24, Needham & Co.'s Global Semiconductor Analyst, Rajvindra Gill, was invited on CNBC to share his insights on NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-quarter earnings report. Here's what he had to say:
According to Gill, the ""massive guide up"" may have to do a lot with the increasing demand for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H-100, a demand he considers to be genuine and highly beneficial for the company. All in all, the company seems to have paved for itself a path for success in the rapidly transforming AI space at present and in the future. In an interview on CNBC Overtime this May, CEO Huang had the following to say on the future of AI:
According to Huang, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent partnership with ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also ""a fantastic growth opportunity"" for both these companies in relation to their AI endeavors. The latter company is now offering the former access to immense amounts of data and ""the engine for transforming all of that data and domain expertise into generative AI models.""
Considering the immense benefits to be gained from active involvement in the AI space, many semiconductor companies are throwing in their cap with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). For example, Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), mentioned in her June interview with CNBC that her company will be working on producing its own next-generation AI chip by the end of 2023. The next-generation GPU is aimed to pave the way for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to rival other semiconductor companies working on AI products today. Here are some comments from Su's interview:
Rising Demand For AI Chips
According to the interview, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) expects to sample its new chip by the third quarter and be in production by the end of 2023. Su's comments also signal that the company is focusing on making AI, particularly generative AI, its priority as it produces its new chips to meet the demand for AI chips. Here's what Su noted on this matter:
According to Su, the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for chips like these is $30 billion in 2023, which her company plans to grow to over $150 billion. This highlights how not just the two companies mentioned here but others like QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) and more will also have their eyes set on the prize in this space. Consequently, several semiconductor companies today are aiming to produce semiconductors and chips for AI to leave their mark and satisfy their customers. As this continues, these companies may soon become some of the best AI stocks or AI chip makers in the market. We have thus compiled a list of the companies we think are the best ones to play the AI boom.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Wednesday the Biden administration is seeking to carefully target U.S. controls on exports to China, but rules will cost firms some revenue.

Last week, U.S. chip company executives met with top Biden administration officials, including Raimondo, to discuss China policy, as the most powerful semiconductor lobby group urged a halt to more curbs under consideration.
Raimondo said the administration is meeting with companies ""to get to the right place so we don't damage American business but quite frankly protect American national security.""
Last year, China accounted for $180 billion in semiconductor purchases, close to a third of the worldwide total of $574.1 billion and the largest single market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

The Biden administration is considering updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment.
""This isn't about holding China back or denying them commodity technology,"" Raimondo said. China wants access to the United States most sophisticated technology ""to advance their military and we're not going to allow that,"" she said.
The ""timetable is as fast as we can and make sure it is correct,"" she added.

The Biden administration is considering updating a sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry and a new executive order restricting some outbound investment.
""This isn't about holding China back or denying them commodity technology,"" Raimondo said. China wants access to the United States most sophisticated technology ""to advance their military and we're not going to allow that,"" she said.
The ""timetable is as fast as we can and make sure it is correct,"" she added.
Raimondo, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Economic Council director Lael Brainard and National Security Council director Jake Sullivan were among government officials who met with Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia last week, according to a source familiar with the meetings.

Shares of SK Hynix rose as much as 9.7%, the most since February 2021, as excitement continues to build over its high-bandwidth memory chips, which it supplies to leading AI processor maker Nvidia Corp. Samsung gained 2.4% after it reported earnings and said it is planning to launch a new HBM chip later this year.
Investors think that Samsung has “fallen behind” Hynix in AI memory-chip development, said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea Ltd. “While both companies claim they have more than 50% share of the HBM market, Hynix results yesterday left no room for doubt as to who is the leader in this space.”
Wall Street investors from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity continue to pile into the semiconductor sector on the prospects for AI, which have helped Nvidia shares more than triple in 2023. Still, Korea’s largest chipmakers have trailed due to sluggishness in the market for traditional memory.
SK Hynix’s stock was muted after it reported earnings Wednesday. But its renewed surge a day later has put it up 65% year to date, more than double Samsung’s rise and on course for its best year since 2017. Hynix shares are expected to rise another 16% over the next 12 months according to the average price target of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

(Reuters) -Chipmaker Intel on Thursday posted a surprise profit as a PC market slump started to ease, and it forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up over 5%.
The market for personal computers has tumbled over the past year, with inventory piling up because consumers had already bought machines needed during the pandemic.
But the glut has started to ease, with PC shipments falling only 11.5% in the June quarter compared to 30% slump in each of the previous two quarters, Canalys data showed.
Shipments rose 11.9% from the first quarter, signaling that vendors' appetite for fresh stock will rebound in the second half of the year.
After over four consecutive quarters of deep declines across its biggest segment that includes personal computers, revenue dropped 12% to $6.8 billion, from $7.7 billion in the year-ago period.
Intel's foundry business, which aims to make chips for other companies, reported revenue of $232 million, up from $57 million a year ago.
Sales by Intel's data center and AI segment fell 15% to $4 billion from $4.7 million in the year-ago quarter.
Cloud majors Microsoft and Alphabet expect to ramp up spending on data centers. While the bulk of that benefit will go to companies like Nvidia that make chips for artificial intelligence, the trend could provide some benefit to the chip industry.
The company forecast adjusted current-quarter earnings per share of 20 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting 16 cents.
Intel forecast adjusted current-quarter revenue of about $12.9 billion to $13.9 billion, compared to estimates of $13.23 billion.
Intel said it expects profit margins to improve in the second half. Its adjusted margins have declined to the lowest since early 2021 when it embarked on a multi-year transition into a contract chipmaker.
It forecast adjusted gross margin of 43% for the third quarter, compared to estimates of 40.6%.
Intel shares have risen about 30% so far this year, compared to a 50% rise on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index in anticipation of an industry recovery.
A wobbly recovery in China, since the company lifted its ""zero-COVID"" policy, has also weighed on Intel, which made 27% of its revenue there last year.

NVDA,2023-07-27 21:11:35,"Alaska's revenue department has owned Nvidia stock since at least 2017, and now counts the chipmaker among its largest holdings.","Alaska has ramped up its bet on Nvidia by more than 50-fold since early 2017.
The state's revenue department commanded a $142 million stake in the chipmaker at the end of June.
Alaska's position peaked at 466,000 shares in 2020, a stake worth $212 million today.
Alaska has boosted its Nvidia wager by more than 50 times within the past seven years, giving it a stake worth $142 million at the end of June, a Markets Insider analysis shows.
The state's revenue department first reported a position in the microchip maker in the first quarter of 2017, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. Adjusted for Nvidia's 4-for-1 stock split in July 2021, it owned fewer than 7,000 shares at the time, worth less than $200,000.
The agency ramped up its bet to a split-adjusted 281,000 shares, worth $16 million, by early 2018. The position peaked in size at the equivalent of 466,000 shares in the second quarter of 2020 — a $44 million stake then that would be worth $212 million today.
Alaskan officials have gradually pared the holding since then, to 337,000 shares worth $142 million at the end of June. But the state still counted the semiconductor giant's stock among its largest positions last quarter, which included $400 million-plus stakes in Apple and Microsoft.
The state agency also invested in Tesla as early as the first quarter of 2017, SEC filings show. It commanded a $380 million stake in Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company as of June 30.
Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft, and other Big Tech stocks have surged in value this year, as investors wager the companies' artificial-intelligence efforts will supercharge their profits. In particular, Nvidia shares have more than tripled in value within the past seven months, and now trade at record highs.
Growth stocks have received a boost from improved market sentiment too. Investors have cheered a drop in inflation from a 40-year high of 9.1% to 3% over the last 12 months. Many are now hoping the Federal Reserve will stop hiking interest rates, and the US economy will escape a recession.
The total value of Alaska's stock portfolio declined slightly to just below $4.4 billion last quarter. The state relies on oil taxes and royalties, federal funding, and investments to finance its spending, as it doesn't tax personal incomes or sales.","Alaska has boosted its Nvidia bet 50-fold in recent years, giving it a $142 million stake in June",454.51999,459.0,467.5,7,2023,27

""Intel's turnaround is finally happening,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester. He also expects ""far better quarters ahead for Intel and most other chipmakers.""","(Reuters) - Intel shares surged 7% on Friday, a day after the chipmaker's unexpectedly strong quarterly report heralded a turnaround in fortunes after a long, margin-sapping struggle due to plummeting PC sales and a highly competitive data center market.
The company's surprise second-quarter profit and its strong earnings and margin forecasts suggested the personal computer market slump was nearing an end, sparking the surge in its stock and the wider chip sector.
Intel is poised to add about $10 billion to its market value, based on its current premarket price of $37. That is already 6% higher than Wall Street's median target of $35 after at least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock.
""Intel's turnaround is finally happening,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester.
He also expects ""far better quarters ahead for Intel and most other chipmakers.""
Intel's results lifted Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia by 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, while Qualcomm rose 1.5%.
A titan of the American chip industry, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as Taiwan's TMSC and Nvidia both in terms of margins and market value as the PC market downturn and stiff competition in the data center market battered its business.
While Intel's shares have rallied 30% this year after a tough 2022, that has paled in comparison to the more than three-fold rise in Nvidia, which became the first chipmaker with a trillion-dollar market value in May after its own ""historic"" forecast.
However, that was largely due to the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, which Intel has missed out on because of its small presence in graphics-processing units and other AI specialist chips that enable the technology behind ChatGPT.
Indeed, Intel's AI and data centers business contracted 15% in the recent quarter, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said a glut in the server central processing units (CPU) market will persist until the second half of the year.
He added that Intel now has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024.
Nonetheless, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities ""don't see AI as an investable theme for Intel currently.""
Intel has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.10, compared with Nvidia's 43.26 and an industry median of 19.95.

NVDA,2023-07-31 21:01:39,"After narrow leadership earlier in the year, broader participation in this year's stock market rally helped turn aside one of the most popular bear cases that nagged markets into the summer months.","July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.
The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.
But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears — that the rally had become too concentrated — has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.
And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.
This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.
Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notable, however, that Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.
In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.
The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.
Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.
And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)
Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.
In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.
Cyclical names — whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy — dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).
And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.
The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.
Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart — up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.
3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).
Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.
Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?
When Is Debt Dangerous?
Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.
Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA
What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt?
As you can see below, NVIDIA had US$11.0b of debt, at April 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But it also has US$15.3b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$4.37b net cash.
How Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?
Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$7.26b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$15.3b in cash and US$4.08b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$540.0m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.
Having regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.16t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!
In fact NVIDIA's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 60% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.
Summing Up
We could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.37b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$5.1b, being 86% of its EBIT. So we are not troubled with NVIDIA's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with NVIDIA .

Large cloud players like Microsoft and Google plan to ramp up spending on data centers in the second half of the year and that spending will skew toward AI chips and infrastructure, analysts said.
However, PC shipments decline has moderated and demand has started showing signs of improvement.
""Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenues to each grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increasing demand for our EPYC and Ryzen processors, partially offset by Gaming and Embedded segment declines,"" said AMD finance chief Jean Hu.
The company forecast current-quarter revenue of about $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect revenue of $5.82 billion.

Apple heads for largest Q3 revenue drop since 2016 as iPhone sales slow
Apple is likely to report a dip in iPhone sales in the April-June quarter as shoppers held out for a new model in a slow economy, making it important for the company to detail how it is using artificial intelligence to augment growth, analysts said. IPhone sales likely fell more than 2% in the period, according to 24 analysts polled by Visible Alpha, compared with a near 3% increase a year earlier and a 1.5% rise in the quarter ended March. The quarterly report could mark a break from an upbeat earnings season for the likes of Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Microsoft that have shown resilience in their cloud businesses and an uptick in digital ad sales.

If you want to skip background activity in the sector this year, then head on over to 5 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider.
Most companies don't list their shares on the stock market. While big ticket names such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla get all the attention, the fact is that only 0.1% of companies in the U.S. have more than 500 employees. Yet, as any fan of the stock market would point out, the biggest companies are often the most valuable or have the most value. And, most of the biggest companies are often either state backed or publicly traded as back of the envelope estimates show that the top ten largest companies in the world in revenue terms are publicly traded.
Going public brings a multitude of benefits for both the firm and the investors that buy its shares. For the firm owners, if the initial public offering (IPO) is successfully executed and a strong business plan generates interest, then their shareholdings can significantly appreciate in value. As a simple example, consider the fact that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Mr. Elon Musk became the company's majority shareholder in less than two years after it was incorporated by just pitching in $6.5 million in a Series A funding round. Now, Musk's current stake in America's largest electric vehicle manufacturer is worth a rather sizeable $190 billion. On a side note, Tesla has also limited the ability of shares that have been pledged for loans and can be collateralized to less than 25% of the stock unless less than $3.5 billion, interesting considering the fact that Musk has pledged almost 58% of his Tesla stock.
So, back to IPOs. Tesla went public in 2010 and since then the stock is up by more than 20,000% - which turns a dollar invested back then to more than $200. Not bad considering that only a few companies can beat or match this performance. For instance, the most expensive share on the stock market is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), whose gains on the market since stock started trading turn a dollar back then into more than $500 now, similar to the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but significantly less than Apple's.
While new firms tend to thrive in an open credit environment with low inflation and stable growth rates, the rapid shifts in the U.S. economy have not deterred a lot of firms from making the plunge and listing their shares for trading. Data shows that as of end July 2023, nearly 91 firms have gone public, and the group has shown modest performance on the market after listing. Out of these, only 53% are trading higher than their listing price. The percentage of firms demonstrating positive returns grows when only the second quarter of 2023 is considered. During the three months between April and June, 34 firms listed their shares for trading and 19 are in positive territory. July continues to extend this trend, as between May and July, an impressive 21 firms out of the 32 that have listed their stock have seen positive buying activity from investors.
One rockstar on the stock market that IPO'd earlier this year is the biotechnology firm Genelux Corporation (NASDAQ:GNLX). Genelux listed its shares in January, and the stock is up an impressive 286% year to date with the biggest share price gains taking place between February and mid-June. It develops treatments for ovarian cancer and has reported some positive data since listing the shares.
A share price pop after an IPO doesn't have to last only a couple of days. After all, the biggest pops take place over the years, decades perhaps. Going long on the right stocks is quite rewarding, with one of the most successful investors of all time Warren Buffett smartly using this strategy. Our own research of some firms that started trading in pennies at the time of their public listing shows that a few have literally turned a dollar into a grand. Consider the story of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of the world's largest electronic commerce retailers. Amazon's shares IPO'd at $15, which translates into $0.075 after adjusting for four stock splits that split the shares 27 to 1. They currently trade at $128, which marks a stunning gain of 170,600%. In short, a dollar put in Amazon's stock in 1997 would be worth $1,706 today - a fact that has turned the firm's founder and former CEO Mr. Jeff Bezos into one of the richest men on Earth.
So, what are some IPOs that have taken place recently that rank high in terms of market capitalization? We took a brief look and narrowed down some firms.

Trending tickers as losses pile up
Stocks are falling after Fitch's downgrade on US credit, leading some of the days biggest losers to the top of Yahoo Finance's trending ticker's page.
Nvidia (NVDA) leads the list with shares down more than 5% amid a broader market sell-off. AMD (AMD) shares are also down on the day, losing more than 7% after reporting earnings after the bell on Tuesday. AMD forecasted revenue of $5.4 billion - $6 billion. Consensus estimates among Wall Street analysts had expected third quarter revenue of $5.85 billion.
Shares of Generac (GNRC) tanked, falling more than 23% as the company said it expected sales full-year 2023 sales declines of 10% to 12%. Previously Generac had expected sales declines of no more than 10%. The company attributed the weaker forecast to softer consumer spending.

Bank of America no longer sees a recession coming
The calls for one of the most talked-about recessions in history are starting to recede.
""We have revised higher our outlook for growth in economic activity this year and next, and no longer expect the economy to fall into a mild recession,"" Bank of America US Economist Michael Gapen wrote on Tuesday.
Bank of America now sees the Fed's interest rate hike ending in a ""soft landing, where growth falls below trend in 2024, but remains positive."" The shift by Bank of America's team of economists from a mild recession in 2024 to no recession at all comes amid growing optimism about the state of the US economy.
Forward-looking indicators for the current quarter are increasing, too. The Atlanta Fed's GPDNow forecaster, which tracks gross domestic product in the US, increased its projection for the 2023 third quarter on Tuesday. It's now projecting economic growth to accelerate to 3.9% in the third quarter, which would be the best quarterly performance for the metric since the fourth quarter of 2021.
An upward revision to first quarter GDP and a recent preliminary reading on second quarter GDP showed the economy has grown at 2.0% or better for the last four quarters.
""Whereas the as-reported data was pointing to a slowdown in activity earlier this year, revisions took this signal away and, together with recent data, point to ongoing resilience,"" Gapen wrote.

Jan. 6 insurrection played a role in Fitch downgrade
Fitch's downgrade of the US government's credit rating on Tuesday took investors by surprise. A Reuters report pointed to the Jan. 6 insurrection as a factor in the decision.
Richard Francis, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, told Reuters on Wednesday that it cited the insurrection in discussions with the Treasury prior to the downgrade.
""It was something that we highlighted because it just is a reflection of the deterioration in governance; it's one of many,"" he said.
""You have the debt ceiling, you have Jan. 6. Clearly, if you look at polarization with both parties ... the Democrats have gone further left and Republicans further right, so the middle is kind of falling apart basically,"" Francis said.
Stocks trending in morning trade
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday morning following the company's most recent earnings release. Shares were down more than 5% as the company reported an 18% decline in revenue and its sales forecast for the current quarter came in short of expectations.
CVS Health Corporation (CVS) popped more than 3% as the company's $88.9 billion in revenue topped estimates for $86.5 billion. The company is also cutting 5,000 jobs to reduce costs, according to reports.
Tesla (TSLA) stock was still trending on Yahoo Finance a day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into certain Tesla vehicles regarding complaints about loss of steering control and power steering. Tesla shares were down nearly 2%.
The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) was down less than 1% after the company's revenue for the most recent quarter came in short of expectations. Kraft Heinz reported revenue of $6.72 billion while analysts had estimated $6.8 billion.
Observers see few immediate effects from Fitch downgrade of US credit
On Tuesday, rating agency Fitch downgraded the US government's top credit from AAA to AA+, marking the second downgrade of US credit in history. But the move might not have an instant impact in Washington.
Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:
Amid anger at the ratings agency for its methodology and a predictable partisan blame game that ensued, there were low expectations in the immediate aftermath that the downgrade would change the state of play in Washington.
Lawmakers are currently headed towards a government shutdown this fall in what could be yet another display of Washington dysfunction, with parallel efforts to head off the next debt limit fight in 2025 moving at a snail’s pace.
""This announcement is much more likely to be dismissed than have a lasting disruptive impact on the US economy and markets,"" noted Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and president of Queens’ College, at the University of Cambridge.
Indeed, the Biden administration immediately waved away the move, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calling it ""arbitrary and based on outdated data."" Nevertheless, the ratings agency pointed to long-term fiscal challenges in making its change that Washington will need to address in the years ahead.
Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted there may be plenty to quibble with around Fitch’s timing, but the move still points to underlying issues like an unsustainable fiscal trajectory and a US political system that ""does not seem up to the challenge it faces.""
In its own statement, Fitch said ""there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters.""

The total return of U.S. stocks was 20.4% as of July, as measured by the net asset value of the Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI). VTI is the broadest of the U.S. stock index funds, owning 3,837 individual stocks. But here are some facts you may not know:
Seven stocks (or about 0.2% of the total holdings) comprise about 23.5% of the total value of the U.S. stock market. These seven (aka the “magnificent seven”) are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia, all tech-related companies.
Those seven stocks have a much greater value than the Extended Market Index Fund (VXF), which owns 3,669 individual stocks that are not in the S&P 500.
Apple alone has a greater market capitalization than the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM).
Those seven stocks accounted for the vast majority of the return of U.S. stocks. It was nearly all of the return though May, but July and August was broader.
With hindsight, of course, there are many explanations for why these seven companies did so well, including the explosion of artificial intelligence. But the startling statistics point to some timeless advice I urge investors to remember.
Smart money is dumb. This isn’t the first year so-called smart beta has been trounced by the market. Underweighting those “obviously overvalued stocks” has backfired. The DFA Small Cap Value Fund (DFSVX) underperformed VTI by 1.48 percentage points annually over the past 15 years. Most smart beta funds badly lagged. Of course it would be just as dumb to overweight these magnificent seven.
Overweighting parts of the market is not diversification, it’s active investing.
Market returns are aways driven by a small number of stocks. Admittedly, this year is extreme but typically 4% of the stocks drive nearly all the return of the market. The other 96% of stocks return about the same as a Treasury Bill.
There is only one way to own next year’s top stocks, whether they be the magnificent seven or the fantastic 40 or whatever financial media dubs the number of future hot stocks, and that is to own them all.
I’m grateful for this year’s magnificent seven. But I’m even more grateful Vanguard founder John C. Bogle gave us the total stock index fund to assure our fair share of the returns irrespective of which stocks drive the market. As he once put it, “Don't look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack.”",Lessons From the Startling Statistics of 2023’s Stock Market,465.07001,442.69,445.14999,8,2023,2

(Reuters) - Tenstorrent, a Canadian startup headed by chip industry veteran Jim Keller that is developing artificial intelligence chips, said on Wednesday it has raised $100 million from Hyundai Motor Group and a Samsung investment fund, among others.
Tenstorrent, which before this funding had already raised $234.5 million was valued at $1 billion, is one of several upstarts looking to challenge Nvidia, the market leader in supplying chips to develop artificial intelligence products like ChatGPT.
Keller, who has previously developed chips for Apple, Tesla and Intel, took over as the startup's CEO earlier this year.
Tenstorrent said it has raised $30 million from Hyundai and $20 million from Kia, with the remaining $50 million coming from Samsung's Catalyst Fund and other investors including Fidelity Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, Epiq Capital and Maverick Capital, among others.
The move marks a return to car technology for Tesla veteran Keller. While Tenstorrent is developing chips to challenge Nvidia in data centers, it is also developing AI chips for a range of other uses, including a deal announced in May with LG for chips that could be used in smart televisions.
The funding round was structured as a debt that will later convert to stock, meaning that Tenstorrent will not formally have a new valuation until it holds another round of equity fundraising, which it says it expects to do next year. Tenstorrent declined to comment on details of the convertible debt.
Tenstorrent makes its own AI chips, but also sells its intellectual property and other technology to customers looking to make their own AI chips. Hyundai established a semiconductor development group last year and said that it plans to use Tenstorrent technology in ""future Hyundai, Kia and Genesis"" vehicles.
“With this investment, the Group expects to develop optimized but differentiated semiconductor technology that will aid future mobilities and strengthen internal capabilities in AI technology development,"" Heung-soo Kim, executive vice president and head of the global strategy office at Hyundai Motor Group, said in a statement.

The drop was set to erase about $13 billion from the company's market value, based on the premarket share price of $117.7. The stock has risen 19% this year, but has underperformed the broader chip industry on worries about smartphone demand.
The company disappointed investors on Wednesday with a current-quarter revenue forecast that was below market estimates, as well as adjusted sales that missed expectations.

The Strange Story Behind ‘Baldur’s Gate 3,’ One of the Year’s Biggest Releases
Isu Petasys Co., which counts Alphabet Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. as customers of its multilayered boards, has seen its share price surge 487% this year – among the biggest gainers on South Korea’s benchmark stock index. The company’s recent boom has also helped boost the value of stakes held by Chairman Kim Sang-Beom and his family to more than $800 million as of August 3.
Kim, who controls 100% of holding company Isu Corp., is just the latest example of how soaring demand for AI investments is creating massive wealth. Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of leading AI company Nvidia, has seen his fortune surge almost three-fold this year to $39.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
“Hardly any local companies directly supply Nvidia and Google, but Isu Petasys got the job,” said Baik Gil-hyun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea Co. “If the AI boom continues, so will the interest in the company.”
Isu Petasys, founded in 1972, began distributing printed circuit boards, mainly for hard disk drives, in 1989. Its parent company, Isu Group, has businesses in industries including chemicals, construction and biopharmaceuticals.
Kim became the group’s chairman in 2000 after his father, Joon-sung, stepped down after four years. Before joining Isu, the younger Kim worked at the now-defunct industrial conglomerate, Daewoo Group, which was founded by his father-in-law Kim Woo-choong, according to local newspaper Korea Joongang Daily.
On top of their 26% stake in Isu Petasys, Kim and his family also own stock in the group’s other publicly traded units, including Isu Specialty Chemical and Isu Chemical. Company filings show that shares pledged for loans account for just under half of the total value of their stakes.
Diversifying Base
Isu Petasys didn’t make Kim available for an interview. The company didn’t respond to questions about their customers or the value of the family’s stakes.
In recent years, Isu Petasys has leaned into the AI craze, diversifying its customer base from predominantly telecommunications manufacturers like Nokia Oyj, and adding technology giants such as Alphabet and Nvidia, according to Park Hyung-woo, an analyst at SK Securities Co. in Seoul.
Orders for its boards used for AI accelerators jumped almost eight-fold to 47.3 billion won ($36.4 million) in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to a June presentation.
Other prominent players in high-end printed circuit boards include Japan’s Ibiden Co., Taiwan’s Unimicron Technology Corp. and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co.
While the company’s revenue grew 3.9% to 172 billion won in the first three months of this year from the previous quarter, its operating profits fell 33% to 20.2 billion won, according to filings.
‘Obvious Beneficiaries’
SK Securities’ Park said he expects a drop in operating profits for the year, partly because Isu Petasys’s AI products are less lucrative than those sold for telecommunications devices. Despite that, he remains optimistic.
“The company is one of the most obvious beneficiaries because it’s actually seeing a growing portion of its revenue from AI-related sales,” Park said.
Increasing tensions between the US and China may have also contributed to Isu Petasys’s expansion, as US companies prefer non-Chinese suppliers, according to analyst Baik. Park said he expects AI-related business to make up 20% of the company’s revenue this year and at least 30% in 2024.
“It doesn’t look like AI is a temporary trend that will fade soon,” he said. “It could change the direction of the industry, like how PCs and smartphones did in the past. Then things look bright for Isu Petasys.”

Cruise ship stocks have been riding high, defying pessimistic market consensus on the industry.
Three of the biggest cruise companies cost hedge funds almost $3 billion in bad bets, per a report.
Hedge funds have lost more than $6 billion on bad bets against cruise ship and hotel operators this year, the Financial Times reported. Of this, the three cruise ship companies account for almost $3 billion of the total mark-to-market losses, according to figures from S3 Partners seen by the outlet.
The cruise industry has surged this year, releasing a wave of pent-up demand from the coronavirus pandemic. Year-to-date, Carnival is up 119%, Royal Caribbean is 112% higher, and smaller rival Norwegian is up 53%.
Other large short positions in Airbnb and Booking.com have also backfired after those stocks jumped 70% and 44% year-to-date respectively.
The stunning performance of the cruise industry can be attributed to making up for lost time after a dreadful pandemic for the sector, where leisure travel was heavily curtailed.
While cruise stocks still remain below their pre-pandemic valuations, the release of pent-up demand has been a boon to the sector.
Fears of recession persist, however, and a falloff in consumer spending could potentially spell bad news for cruise operators.
The stock market's remarkable 2023 rally has been carried by investor excitement surrounding artificial intelligence.
Tech stocks like Nvidia, Tesla, and Microsoft have all grabbed the headlines thanks to their stellar performance – but some of the best-performing stocks come from a more unlikely source: cruise operators.
Such a resilient recovery has confounded the expectations of short-sellers – many of whom were predicting a rout for the industry.

NVDA,2023-08-07 05:00:00,"When the chip designer Arm shortly sells shares in this year’s most closely watched initial public offering (IPO), it will represent for many the final Americanisation of a great British company.","When the chip designer Arm shortly sells shares in this year’s most closely watched initial public offering (IPO), it will represent for many the final Americanisation of a great British company.
Born from the ashes of Acorn Computers in Cambridge 33 years ago, Arm was a constituent of the FTSE 100 until its takeover by the Japanese investment group SoftBank for £24bn in 2016.
When that deal was considered by Arm’s board in the weeks that followed the Brexit referendum, its directors counted years of experience accumulated at famous British brands including EMI, easyJet, Vodafone and Pilkington.
Re-emerging onto the public market on the other side of the Atlantic with a $60bn valuation in its sights, Arm will be guided by a board remade with Wall Street squarely in mind and featuring former executives from AOL, Intel and Qualcomm.
They echo the Stateside skew of the company’s 13-strong leadership team, whose members are mostly based in the US and frequent Arm’s main site on Rose Orchard Way in San Jose, California. That base is 5,000 miles from its leafy Cambridge birthplace that is still labelled the group’s global headquarters.
And yet Arm might have expected to have become more American before now, considering the US accounts for about half of all microchip revenues in an industry where sovereignty is paramount and the US and China vie for supremacy.
In fact, the company could have been acquired by arch rival Intel in its early years, long before a plan was hatched by SoftBank to fold it into the artificial intelligence leader Nvidia. That move was blocked by competition authorities in early 2022, sending Arm down today’s IPO path.
Given the UK’s patchy record at growing its technology companies into world beaters, the fact its microprocessor designs are licensed 1000 times a second for use in smartphones, laptops, industrial sensors and cars – generating a handful of cents in royalties each time – is something to cheer.
Arm would be cheered louder at home if only SoftBank supremo Masayoshi Son had succumbed to Rishi Sunak’s overtures and agreed to relist Arm shares here.
Even though it is currently supporting 2,800 well-paid jobs in Cambridge, does the choice of Wall Street over the City of London represent a turning point for what remains the UK’s flagship technology firm?
The company benefited from US influence from day one. If Apple hadn’t been looking for a new processor for a portable device it developed many years before the iPhone, the Arm project would have been gradually wound down within struggling Acorn. For a modest $2.5m, Apple entered a joint venture with its one-time competitor in home computers and Arm was spun out to serve them both and see if it could build a wider customer base.
Even that nascent technology was American by design. Eager to leapfrog the pack, Acorn’s top engineers, Roger – later Sophie – Wilson and Steve Furber, were enchanted by a 1981 project that had emerged from the University of California, Berkeley to produce a high-performance central processing unit on a single chip.
The rationale for the reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) design was that 80 per cent of the time a chip used just 20 per cent of its instructions, so the rest could be stripped out to reduce cost and power consumption and tasks could be broken down into a handful of simple instructions.
Other RISC projects were fixed on producing high-end business workstations but Wilson and Furber favoured the mass market. Their Acorn RISC Machine – later Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) – delivered 25 times the performance of the top-selling BBC Micro computer.
The design featured in the Acorn Archimedes in 1987 and, six years later, Apple’s MessagePad, which also became known as the Newton. After some fallow years, liftoff happened in 1997 when the first Nokia mobile phone to feature Arm’s designs, the 6110 that also included the addictive Snake game, was unveiled.
A picture of the handset ensured the prospectus for Arm’s first IPO in 1998 sizzled, especially with fund managers in the US, a market that at the time lagged Europe for its nifty cellphones.
Arm’s instruction set architecture (ISA) – a digital rulebook that determines how the microprocessor in any device is controlled by software – broadened its application and the company broadened out too. The company charged into the US in August 2004, paying $913m for Artisan Components, its first significant acquisition, which was poorly received by investors who sent the shares down 18 per cent on the day.
In retrospect, some Arm executives regarded the Artisan deal as the right idea at the wrong price – and perhaps it was even the wrong target too. What few realised – and the company did not acknowledge publicly – was that Arm viewed the deal as an insurance policy in its long-term face-off with Intel, the US microchip giant irked at the British upstart’s colonisation of the mobile space.
The deal certainly achieved a shift in Arm’s locus towards the US West Coast, where many of its customers were also based.
The leadership followed. High-flying executive Simon Segars relocated with his family from Cambridge in 2007 to fix an initially troubled integration, making him an instant favourite to succeed Warren East as Arm’s boss when the vacancy arose in 2013. Some insiders expected Segars to return to the UK at that point but he opted to remain in the US.
These days the company is led by a veteran American, Rene Haas, a Los Angeles Lakers basketball fan who often dresses head-to-toe in black like his Silicon Valley counterparts.
On his watch, the culture has toughened. Internally, Arm has culled blue-sky research projects to focus on more commercially viable activities. Externally, it has explored different pricing models with a view to fattening margins.
Arm has its low-priced royalties to thank for its ubiquity. Its designs have been used an astonishing 250 billion times. But this has led to frustration that the company has missed out on the growth and rocketing valuations enjoyed by its semiconductor peers.
What’s risky is attempting to shift the calculation of its fee from a slice of the chip’s value to a portion of the value of the end-device such as an in-car component or tablet computer.
What is easier to benefit from is supplying its designs to more expensive chips, such as those powering computer servers that store reams of data remotely. The Graviton chips custom-made by the cloud computing market leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS), contain Arm blueprints.
After 15 years of trying, the company’s breakthrough in this field is sure to be emphasised as a key growth opportunity when it comes to courting new investors this autumn.
So too will be the buzz around AI, whose applications are portrayed as a step-change for computing but from Arm’s point of view still demand the upwards-only improvements in performance and power efficiency to which it has grown accustomed. And before AI generates meaningful revenues, the company can point to a 5.7 per cent increase in sales last year – creditable after a dip in the smartphone market from which it is eager to demonstrate it can diversify from.
The biggest indicator of corporate change emerged last summer, when Arm sued Qualcomm, one of its largest customers and a key developer of 5G technology, alleging the breach of licence agreements and trademark infringement.
Arm demanded the destruction of some designs it said were transferred without its consent from Nuvia, a start-up Qualcomm acquired a year earlier that had been set up by a group of former Apple chip designers.
It was a classic semiconductor industry spat, with parallels of the row between the mobile giants Apple and Samsung that rumbled on for years. Yet it was rare for Arm to be drawn into something where the stakes were so high.
Qualcomm’s use of Arm designs has been expected to increase its market share in personal computers and cars. The American company believed it had licences covering the Nuvia technologies and said the lawsuit, scheduled for September 2024, marked “an unfortunate departure” from the pair’s longstanding relationship.
This aggressive tone is mirrored by moves that may test Arm’s long-held industry independence. Success in recruiting Nvidia and others as anchor investors ahead of the IPO would certainly juice the company valuation but how to appease those among its 1,000 partners that didn’t get the invitation to buy early?
On the eve of that share sale, is Arm still the quirky British interloper with a unique business model or just another cutthroat American tech stock dreaming of Tesla-like multiples? Currently both descriptions resonate. But British or American, its future success relies on adopting the only culture that Wall Street gets – growth at all costs.

Based on historical context, this stock surge would be in its “later-innings,” Morgan Stanley strategist Edward Stanley wrote in a note. “Bubbles tend to rally a median 154% in the 3 years pre-peak.”
While Nvidia has been the poster-child for the excitement around all-things AI, Stanley says the broader AI benchmarks, like the MSCI USA IMI Robotics & AI Select Net USD Index, have risen far more modestly. The gauge is up 46%.
The Santa Clara, California-based company has been at the heart of this year’s frenzy around AI and its bullish outlook was proof that spending on AI computing is boosting sales.
To be sure, stocks across the sector do not have uniform charecteristics. Therefore, Stanley says that given the idiosyncrasies of individual names, “drawing conclusions on the speed of upswing and drawdown of bubbles can only be usefully or fairly done at an index level.”

Then look at the NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price. It's 598% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. It's also good to see the share price up 56% over the last quarter. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.
In light of the stock dropping 4.4% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During five years of share price growth, NVIDIA achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.3% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 47% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 230.54.
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
This free interactive report on NVIDIA's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
What About Dividends?
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for NVIDIA the TSR over the last 5 years was 604%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
A Different Perspective
It's nice to see that NVIDIA shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 151% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 48% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

But the long-term projections didn't help the stock, which fell more than 7% in the next trading session as analysts feared expectations may have grown too high.
Overall, the Nasdaq Composite (AMD) is now down nearly 2% over the last two weeks, which spanned most of big tech earnings.
The signs could point to the AI stock bubble popping. On Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Edward Stanley released an analysis of 70 prior bubbles over the past 100 years, including the dot-com surge and recent excitement in cryptocurrencies. The median return in three years for those bubbles is 154%. If Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 200% so far this year, and large cap tech are the proxy for how far the AI boom has gone, then it's likely ""late innings"" for the AI stock rally, Stanley wrote.
""With typical 3-year returns into bubble peaks of 150%, one could argue that this rally surpasses most others,"" Stanley wrote.
But Stanley believes the AI bubble of 2023 isn't the same as those other 70 bubbles. For one, measuring the rally is hard given that the AI index Morgan Stanley tracks is up just 50% this year, compared to the 200% surge in large cap tech.
""Judging where we are on the run-up in market exuberance is extremely challenging,"" Stanley wrote. ""This is the case with AI today. Many investors would be forgiven for thinking AI investment funds are making new all-time highs on the back of Generative AI excitement. In fact, (they're) not. Several underlying stocks are, but as an investment theme, performance is still 14% below prior market high.""
Wall Street buzz quieting down
AI has been the buzzword of Wall Street in 2023. It sent strategists boosting their outlook on the S&P 500. Roundhilll created a new buzzy ETF called CHAT, and investors have been searching deep into the world of tech to find the next big AI winner.
Entering second-quarter earnings season, the AI promise seemed to still be fueling stock jumps. In July, a Bloomberg report about Apple working on its own form of ChatGPT sent the stock up about 1%. A day before, Microsoft shares rose about 4% as the company announced pricing for its M365 Copilot AI product. Both stocks finished at all-time highs on the day the developments broke.
But when prompted to give specifics on AI projects, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook didn't bite. He called AI and machine learning ""core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build,"" without expanding too far into coming products like the ChatGPT-style bot Bloomberg mentioned.
""We tend to announce things as they come to market,"" Cook said. ""And that's our aim and I'd like to stick to that.""
While a lack of AI excitement likely didn't drive the negative price action on Apple's stock, companies that have played up their AI success aren't benefiting as much this quarter either. With the exception of Meta (META), which attributed AI to boosting revenues in the current quarter, investors have seemed more concerned with the current state of things rather than celebrating potential AI benefits to come down the line.
Snap (SNAP) boasted more than 150 million users have engaged with its My AI chatbot.
But Wall Street appeared stuck on the cost of the investment. The stock fell more than 14% after the company reported.
""The challenge here is Snap's investments to rebuild its (direct response) ad platform and offer newer products and tools to improve engagement are resulting in higher (artificial intelligence and machine learning) costs pressuring gross margins, EBITDA, and free-cash-flow,"" Ron Josey, Citi managing director of internet equity research, wrote after Snap earnings.
It's not just that AI callouts aren't boosting stock prices this quarter, either. Momentum has slowed for some of the industry's biggest names leading into their reports, too. Nvidia, which is expected to report earnings on August 23, has seen its stock rise more than 200% this year due to its AI prospects. In the past week though, the stock has fallen 4% in the past week and is up just 6% over the last month, suggesting the stock's meteoric rise may be taking a break.
""Post-earnings reaction could see some near-term stock consolidation following the 200%+ move up YTD,"" Bank of America research analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Monday.

NVDA,2023-08-08 01:17:14,"""Demand isn't the issue, its supply and importantly the pace with which US cloud service providers are able to set up genAI compute instances.""","Nvidia is still a ""top pick"" stock at Bank of America, even after its AI-driven year-to-date rally of 209%.
The bank said Nvidia's upcoming 2nd-quarter earnings report will be ""less shock and awe"" and more about execution.
The biggest risk for Nvidia is its ability to scale the supply of its AI-enabling GPU chips, according to BofA.
Nvidia remains a ""top sector pick"" ahead of its upcoming second-quarter earnings report, even after its stunning AI-driven year-to-date stock rally of 209%.
That's according to Bank of America's Vivek Arya, who in a Monday note reiterated his ""Buy"" rating and $550 price target for Nvidia, suggesting potential upside of 22% from current levels.
While Arya still sees a rosy future for Nvidia as it helps power the growing artificial intelligence industry with its GPU accelerators, he admits that the company will have ""less shock and awe"" for investors after it issued a massively bullish guidance update in May. Instead, Arya expects Nvidia to transition towards a period of execution that will be defined by its ability to scale supply to meet demand.
""We expect the sentiment to be [a] bit more measured. Demand isn't the issue, its supply and importantly the pace with which US cloud service providers are able to set up genAI compute instances,"" Arya said.
Arya expects Nvidia to report second-quarter revenue of at or slightly above $11 billion, which would represent year-over-year revenue growth of 64%. Arya said he also expects Nvidia's third-quarter revenue to accelerate up to 100% to about $12 billion.
But perhaps most importantly, the near-term direction of Nvidia's stock price hinges on guidance comments from CEO Jensen Huang, and as to whether these revenue gains are a short-term blip or have staying power.
""Investors will look for clues on sustainability of these elevated forecasts considering a lukewarm US cloud service provider capex environment,"" Arya said. ""Listen for management commentary around continued sales acceleration.""
The post-earnings reaction to Nvidia's upcoming earnings report could ultimately see some ""near-term stock consolidation"" after its solid year-to-date rally. In other words, expect Nvidia stock to trade sideways or slightly lower after it reports earnings after the market close on August 23, according to Arya.
But Nvidia's long-term opportunity is what Arya is focused on. The analyst estimated that Nvidia could ""march towards"" $20 to $25 in long-term earnings per share, which would help make its current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 39x more digestible for investors.
""We forecast AI servers to grow at a 37% compounded annual growth rate from 1.23 million in 2023 (8% to 10% of all servers) towards 4.4 million by 2027 (+25% of all servers), enabling Nvidia's total sales to expand at a 26% CAGR to $109 billion,"" Arya said.
And BofA isn't the only Wall Street bank with a $100+ billion revenue projection for Nvidia by 2027. Mizuho said the company could generate more than $300 billion in revenue by 2027. For context, Nvidia generated revenue of about $27 billion last year.

US stocks jumped on Monday as investors continued to digest stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings results.
With 85% of S&P 500 companies having already reported results, 81% are beating profit estimates by a median of 7%, while 64% are beating revenue estimates by a median of 3%, according to data from Fundstrat. Investors are still waiting for earnings results from Disney, Nvidia, Eli Lilly, and UPS, among others.
Investors are also turning their attention to upcoming inflation data and whether that will impact the trajectory of the Federal Reserve's current interest rate trajectory.
July CPI data will be released later this week on Thursday. That, combined with the August jobs report and the August CPI report will inform the Fed as to whether they hike interest rates again at their September FOMC meeting. A recent surge in gas prices could impact the upcoming inflation reports.
According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the Fed is expected to keep the Fed Funds Rate at its current range of 5.25% to 5.50% until March 2024, when the central bank is expected to slightly cut interest rates by 25 basis points. For the Fed to cut interest rates, inflation would have to be decisively on track to near the Fed's long-term 2% target.

“In the past quarter, we have received strong demand for model training and related services on cloud infrastructure, which were only partially fulfilled due to the near-term supply chain constraints globally,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, who steps down in September, told analysts on a conference call. He will focus on Alibaba’s cloud business full-time after ceding his dual roles to Alibaba co-founders Joseph Tsai and Eddie Wu.
A shortage of high-powered semiconductors is undermining Chinese efforts to keep pace with the US in AI. Washington has banned Chinese firms from buying the most advanced chips made by Nvidia Corp., impeding attempts to build rivals to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Nvidia has since created an inferior version of its most potent A100 chips for the country, and major Chinese tech firms including Alibaba have reportedly placed billions of dollars’ worth of orders.
The Biden administration on Wednesday announced new rules to partially limit American firms’ investments in quantum computing and AI sectors in China, which could further disadvantage the Asian country in its ambition to advance its technological capabilities.

The opportunity arises because the Johnson & Johnson (ticker: JNJ) exchange offer for Kenvue (KVUE), which holds the consumer health business formerly owned by J&J, allows holders of less than 100 shares of J&J stock—or an odd lot—to get a full allocation of Kenvue if they submit all their shares. Other J&J shareholders are likely to be prorated, meaning they won’t get a full allocation of Kenvue.

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, NVIDIA's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership
Insiders have been selling lately
To get a sense of who is truly in control of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 4.8% in value last week. However, the 136% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.
View our latest analysis for NVIDIA
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
Insider Ownership Of NVIDIA
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. Insiders own US$42b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.
General Public Ownership
With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Next Steps:
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with NVIDIA , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Rising oil prices complicates the roadmap for taming inflation
Signs that energy prices are trending upwards could impact how the Fed approaches its interest rate policy. While the latest Consumer Price Inflation data for July revealed a modest increase of 0.2%, another bout of rising price inflation in energy commodities complicate the picture for central bankers looking to tame price pressures, Finance’s Jared Blikre reports
In the latest CPI report, fuel oil was up a whopping 3.0% for the month, even though it crashed 26.5% year over year. Similarly, utility gas was up 2.0% in July but down 13.7% from a year ago. The closely watched gasoline component crashed 19.9% from last year but inched up 0.2% for the month.
The monthly rise in energy subcomponents is not necessarily worrisome by itself. But short-term charts of crude oil, natural gas — and even the entire commodity complex overall — are screaming ""bullish"" and point to larger potential increases in the inflation statistics in the months ahead.
Consumer sentiment little changed in August
Consumer sentiment was little changed in August, marking a pause in what's been an otherwise exuberant summer for economic data as US economy has largely been more resilentt than many expected.
The first reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment Index came in at 71.2, in line with economists expectations and slightly below last month's reading of 71.6. Inflation expectations ticked lower, with consumers now anticipating inflation at 3.3% in the next year.

After strong gains this year, U.S. equities have lost momentum in August, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting two straight weeks of declines for the first time in 2023 on Friday.

Goldman Sachs expects the Fed to start cutting rates in the second quarter of 2024, but has cautioned that rates could hold steady if inflation does not cool fast enough.

NVDA,2023-08-14 10:00:09,The tech trade is having a painful August. You could put all the blame -- or most of it — on one thing.,"What goes up must eventually go down.
And in the case of markets right now, Treasury yields are still going up and hot tech stocks are finally coming down.
So far this month, the Nasdaq Composite is off by about 4.2%. Top tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are teetering on 10% drops for the month. Mighty Microsoft's (MSFT) stock — for all the company's AI sizzle and love affair with OpenAI — is off by 4% in August. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has shed 2.1%.
The only big-name tech stock working higher this month is Amazon (AMZN) (up 4%) — maybe because it's reportedly tracking whether workers back in the office are actually working. More productivity means more profits for Amazon (maybe), and there's nothing investors love more.
The pullback in tech coincides with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 3.95% in late July to above 4.1% today. Yields back in early April were around 3.3%, for perspective.
Blame Fitch's US credit rating downgrade prior to an avalanche of US debt issuances or the retrenchment in inflation sending cash into higher risk areas of markets. Whatever it is, higher yields could be here to stay for the time being, and that spells bad news for tech investors.
In fact, there is chatter on the Street that yields may have further room to run.
""Despite rising odds that the Fed will pause at the September meeting, yields remain firm. Without taking any factors into account and just looking at the chart, yields do not look like a top to us and look poised to retest the highs from 2022. The 10 and 30-year have been making higher highs and higher lows since April and we’d need to see at least a lower low before suggesting a top may be in-place,"" the strategy team at RenMac wrote in a new client note.
The old rule of thumb is that tech stocks don't like a land of elevated yields. Higher borrowing costs, more attractive returns on cash, and more aggressive discounts future growth are all part of the challenge facing tech highfliers when interest rates rise.
""Our view is these higher rates, as we stay above the 4% level, will serve to put a cap on further valuation expansion. This had been a key driver of stock returns this year,"" the always astute market watcher Keith Lerner at Truist tells me.
Added Lerner, ""Already stocks are trading at the highest valuation level of the past 20 years, outside of the pandemic overshoot, which coincided with the Federal Funds rate at zero as opposed to above 5% today and a 10-year yield below 1%.""
Tread carefully, tech fans — at least until yields back up to below 4%.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Chanos' 5 Short Positions in 2023.
Investment manager Jim Chanos has made a name for himself on Wall Street by taking bold short positions even when the market seems to be in an uptrend. True to his trading strategy, the famed short seller took a swipe at the market early in the year, reiterating that valuation levels had run out of hand. He targeted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was on a roll amid the AI boom, and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), a company he believes faces an uncertain future due to its reliance on the Chinese market.
Best known for predicting the collapse of the energy group Enron, Chanos raised concerns that the market was not in a position to overcome the rising interest rate environment. He also raised concerns over the risk of falling corporate profitability. Chanos noted that the market expected corporate profits to rise by 12% this year and inflation dropping to 2% amid the aggressive interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.
When the famed Wall Street hedge fund manager, who founded Kynikos Associates in 1985, made these claims, the S&P 500 was up by about 5%, bouncing after a 19% loss in 2022. While things were not as expensive as the previous year, the hedge fund manager reiterated they were not cheap, as the market was at 18 times forward earnings and profit margins were at all-time highs.
“I’ve been on the Street [since] 1980 [and] not one bear market has ever traded above nine times to 14 times the previous peak earnings,” the Chanos & Co. founder told CNBC’s “Fast Money” earlier this month.
Chanos has reiterated his concerns on whether the bullish scenario will hold. The legendary short seller remains short a number of counters after an impressive 2022 when his short-only fund Ursus beat the overall market. The fund gained 18% against a 19% loss for the S&P 500.
Jim Chanos also shared his thoughts on the real estate sector. He believes the office sector continues to be troubled, especially in big cities. Consequently, he has raised several hundred million dollars to take short positions on US-listed real estate investment trusts.
According to the short seller, legacy data centers led by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR) and Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) face growing competition from tech giants. As Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the largest tenants of data centers, resort to building their own data centers, Chanos believes REITS with big exposure to data centers will be in trouble.
In addition to commercial real estate, Chanos has been skeptical about cryptocurrency, in particular Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), which he believes faces stiff competition. He has also taken aim at the excessive hype around artificial intelligence as investors continue to pile on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) on the belief they are well poised to cash in on the disruptive technology.
Our methodology
With the forward price to earnings of the S&P 500 above 18x, Chanos believes any reversion to the mean as earnings deflate will result in significant stock price declines. For this article we scanned Chanos' Q1'2023 portfolio and picked 10 stocks in which he initiated PUT options this year.
10. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)
Value of Put Option: $294,213
Year to Date Decline: 35%
Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a financial services company offering a platform allowing people to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. While the stock is up by about 35% year to date, it remains under pressure in the aftermath of Google parent Alphabet dumping nearly 90% of its shares in the trading app.
The selloff comes as the user base in the Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) trading platform continues to shrink, fueling revenue concerns. The stock is already down by 86% from its all-time high, a drop that has allowed the likes of Chanos to generate significant returns through their Put trades in the stock.
9. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)
Value of Put Option: $351,870
Year to Date Gain: 76%
In recent years Jim Chanos has been skeptical about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Early last year, the short seller raised doubts about the ride-sharing company’s ability to become EBITDA positive.
Despite the concerns, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been in fine form, rallying by 33% from when Chanos called the stock out. It is also up by about 76% year to date.
8. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG)
Value of Put Option: $615,114
Year to Date Decline: 14%
Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) faces an uncertain future amid the growing risk of recession. The company which develops and sells motorcycles has been under pressure going as the stock has dipped about 14% year to date.
In a recession, customers are unlikely to spend on discretionary purchases such as motorcycles. Likewise, Chanos remaining confident of a US recession explains why he is short on Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG).
7. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)
Value of Put Option: $823,824
Year to Date Gain: 14%
Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shares have gained in the second half of 2023 amid strong Q2 results. With management expecting demand for machines to be high amid growth in nonresidential construction in North America, the stock could continue rallying, putting Chanos and other short sellers under pressure on the Put trades on the stock.
6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)
Value of Put Option: $986,012
Year to Date Gain: 28%
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was battered last year amid a Chinese government crackdown on tech giants and the ongoing tussle between the US and China over semiconductors. Fast forward, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has bounced back in 2023, rallying by more than 28%, year to date, even as Chanos remains bearish on the stock.
Even though Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is down by 20% from its 2022 peak, it’s been in fine form as it benefits from growing hype around companies developing chips for the AI revolution.

For the first time in 2023, the tech-heavy index has posted losses two weeks in a row.
US tech stocks are now on their longest losing streak of the year, with mixed inflation data and tumbling semiconductor stocks leading to a disappointing start to August for markets.
The Nasdaq Composite has fallen over 2% each of the past two weeks — the first time it's posted losses for two weeks in a row since December 2022, according to data from Refinitiv.
The tech-heavy index has jumped over 30% year-to-date, powered higher by frenzied interest in AI and cooling inflation.
But it has shed 5% in August alone, with signs of inflationary stickiness and a sell-off in semiconductor stocks fueling losses in what's typically the quietest month of the year for investors.
The US Consumer Price Index, which gauges inflation by measuring the cost of the average American shopping basket, came in at a lower-than-expected reading of 3.2% for July on Thursday.
But on Friday, the Producer Price Index — which measures the prices factories receive for their goods — offered investors some food for thought.
US PPI rose 0.3% in July, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, outpacing economists' expectations and signaling elevated inflation could carry on weighing on the US economy.
Sliding semiconductor stocks also weighed on the Nasdaq, with Advanced Micro Devices, Micron, and Nvidia all posting losses of over 7% last week.
Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 gauge slipped 0.3% over the five days ending August 11 to also rack up a second straight week of losses.

The excitement surrounding AI is palpable. The popularity of Chat GPT and other LLMs - large language models - has created what many consider an AI “hype cycle”. It seems any mention of AI by a publicly traded company is enough to create an appreciable bump in its stock price.
But CNBC’s Jim Cramer believes otherwise. The “Mad Money” host stated on his show that, ""I know there's a lot of hype here, and in some individual cases it is overblown, but anybody who tells you that AI is pure hype, that person is only fooling herself.”
Whether the hype is real remains to be seen, but AI and AI related technology remains a material part of the current economy. For investors looking to gain exposure, ETFs can be an attractive option, offering exposure to a basket of companies directly and indirectly involved in the AI industry.

NVDA,2023-08-15 02:18:55,"Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia. Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded flat to higher. Solana led the winners.","Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia but failed to breach the US$29,500 resistance level. Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to higher. Solana’s SOL led the winners. As risk sentiment improved in the wake of weak U.S. inflation data, last week saw an inflow for digital asset investment products after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market logged the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher Monday on the back of a rally led by chipmaker Nvidia.
A blessing in disguise
Bitcoin edged up 0.35% in the last 24 hours to US$29,408.45 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.91%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.
Bitcoin’s price has remained largely within the $29,000 to $30,600 range for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could be a blessing in disguise, Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.
“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.
“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.
Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.
Greco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level — a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days —which reached its highest ever level over the first week of August.
“The data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,” said Greco.
“These numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors’ interest towards the digital asset market,” he added.
Meanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million — roughly 93% of the total inflows.
The inflows to digital asset investment products are “likely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote in the report.
Along with Bitcoin, Ether gained 0.22% to US$1,844.14 and added 1.05% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded higher with the exception of Dogecoin, which inched 0.06% lower to US$0.07477 but gained 2.05% for the week.
Solana’s SOL led the winners, rising 3.50% to US$25.17 for a 9.42% weekly gain.
Synesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application “Workspace by Synesis” on Monday.
The app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synesis One claims, will result in a “fully traceable and auditable” data supply chain.
Outside the top 10 cryptos, HBAR, the utility token of distributed ledger technology platform Hedera Hashgraph, saw its price surge 13.59% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06666. That contributed to a weekly jump of 12.89%.
HBAR received a boost after Dropp, a Hedera-based micropayments application, was added to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform FedNow. The Fed-run service allows merchants to “accept small-value purchases digitally without paying large transaction fees” following its launch in July.
The total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.40% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 47.95% to US$28.52 billion.",Bitcoin trading sideways; NFT transactions soar; Nvidia leads Wall Street rally,437.53,439.39999,434.85999,8,2023,15
NVDA,2023-08-15 18:29:54,Shares of chip giant Nvidia are rising ahead of its quarterly print due out next week as Wall Street analysts raise their price targets on the stock.,"Nvidia (NVDA) stock traded up more than 8% in the past two sessions amid a string of bullish Wall Street updates ahead of the chipmaker's earnings next week.
""We expect a significant beat"" for Nvidia's fiscal second quarter wrote Baird's Tristan Gerra and his team in a note to investors on Tuesday.
The analysts cited ""very significant momentum in AI demand for Nvidia,"" and raised their price target on the stock to $570 from $475 while maintaining an Outperform rating.
On Monday shares of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chipmaker rose 7% after a bullish note from Morgan Stanley analysts.
""NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters,"" wrote Joseph Moore and his team.
Meanwhile UBS analysts raised their price target to $540 from $475, writing ""NVDA is quite literally serving as ""kingmaker"" as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.""
Nvidia stock has been on fire since the start of 2023. The chipmaker led the tech sector higher earlier in the year as it moved center stage amid an AI craze, thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products.
Information Technology stocks have pulled back a bit in recent weeks amid concerns of an overbought market and rising bond yields. It's worth noting August is historically a weak month for stocks. Since the start of August, Nvidia shares are down 6%.
""We think the recent selloff is a good entry point,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore.
Nvidia shares are up more than 205% since the start of 2023. In May, the stock skyrocketed more than 26% in one session after the company posted a better than expected quarter with guidance that blew past Wall Street estimates.
The company said it expects revenue of $11 billion for its fiscal second quarter, plus or minus 2% versus Wall Street estimates of $7.2 billion.
Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, with 52 buy recommendations, 6 holds, and 1 sell. The average price target on the stock is $507.

Ron DeSantis tells Disney to drop lawsuit, says he's 'moved on'
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signaled Monday that he wants to end his longtime feud with Disney (DIS).
""We've basically moved on. They’re suing the state of Florida. They're going to lose that lawsuit,"" DeSantis said in an interview with CNBC.
""So what I would say is, drop the lawsuit,"" DeSantis added. ""Let's move forward. I'm totally fine with that, but I'm not fine with giving extraordinary privileges to one special company at the exclusion of everybody else.""
The ongoing political firestorm, which has seen multiple lawsuits and countersuits from both sides, stems from what has largely been seen as a politically targeted response over Disney's reaction to the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade.
In 2022, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek condemned the law at the company's annual shareholder meeting after initially deciding not to speak publicly on the matter.
In response, DeSantis signed a bill into law that allows him to take control of the company's long-standing special tax district, formerly known as Reedy Creek.
Most recently, Florida's attorney general filed a motion to dismiss an April lawsuit from the entertainment giant, arguing immunity for DeSantis.
Disney had alleged in federal court that DeSantis and other officials launched a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"" for its stance on the parental rights bill when the state stripped the company of the self-governing power it held for 55 years.
Disney shares were down about 1.5% on Tuesday.

Fears of a slump grow after China cuts rates and withholds economic data
Disappointing economic data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday fueled concerns of a sluggish recovery as Beijing unexpectedly cut policy rates and withheld information on youth unemployment.
The country missed expectations in retail sales and industrial production for July, the new data showed, adding to signs that the nation's economic troubles have yet to reverse. Industrial production rose 3.7% annually in July, missing a forecast of a 4.4% year over year increase, while retail sales lifted by 2.5%, well below analysts' targets of 4.5%.
China's central bank also cut key interest rates ahead of the fresh round of data, indicating that the government is eager to juice economic growth.
China cut its one-year medium-term lending facility rate by 15 basis points to 2.5%, marking the most significant cut since the first full year of the pandemic, in 2020. In another move that has drawn criticism from market observers, China chose to omit the latest youth unemployment statistics, to grapple with complexities in the numbers. That key indicator of the nation's economic health previously hit a record high of 21.3% percent in June.
China's problems can become the world's problems as the globe's second largest economy struggles to regain its footing. The International Monetary Fund has previously projected China would drive global growth through close to the end of the decade and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday that China’s slowdown was a risk factor for the American economy.

Strength of US consumer not accurately reflected in markets: BofA
The US consumer has remained resilient in the face of inflation with July retail sales surprising to the upside.
But that resiliency hasn't been fully priced into the market, Bank of America argued in a new note on Monday.
As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports:
After recently eliminating its call for a recession in 2024, BofA's economics team expects consumer spending to rise 2.3% in 2023 (up from 2.1% previously) and 1.1% in 2024 (up from 0.1% previously).
This, BofA equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian argues, means Consumer Discretionary stocks should be priced differently.
""Our economists forecast a soft landing, but investors appear positioned for a [Great Financial Crisis]-style recession,"" Subramanian wrote in a new note on Monday. ""Active funds’ relative weight in Consumer Discretionary is at all-time lows in our data history for both long-only funds and hedge funds.""
In the note, Bank of America upgraded the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) to Overweight from Underweight. The call comes as some of the sector ETF's largest holdings including TJX Companies (TJX) are set to report earnings amid a week headlined by retail.

Home Depot posts slight earnings beat as same-store sales fall
Home Depot (HD) stock climbed roughly 2% higher in early trading on Tuesday after the home improvement giant posted a slight earnings beat as consumers spent less on big-ticket discretionary items such as appliances.
As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:
Two things are catching Wall Street's attention in the early going.
First, Home Depot's same-store sales fell 2% amid a pullback in shopper transactions. This is now the third straight quarter of declining same-store sales for the Georgia-based retailer.
And secondly, the retailer only reiterated its full-year guidance despite a second quarter beat. The company expects full-year sales to drop between 2% to 5% compared to fiscal 2022. Diluted earnings per share are expected to drop between 7% and 13% compared to last year.
""With continued pressure in certain big-ticket, discretionary categories, Home Depot took the conservative approach [with guidance],"" Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich wrote in a client note.

By Saeed Azhar, Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A
NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes closed sharply lower on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected retail sales data stoked worries interest rates could stay higher for longer, while U.S. big banks dropped on a report that Fitch could downgrade some lenders.
The Commerce Department report showed retail sales grew 0.7% last month against expectations of a 0.4% rise, suggesting the U.S. economy remains strong.
After the data, traders' bets of a pause on hikes by the Federal Reserve next month stayed intact at 89%, yet analysts said investors were worried rates could stay at current levels longer than anticipated.
Banks saw the brunt of the selling as investors grew more anxious about interest rates. The U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted for over a year, with longer-term bonds yielding less than short-term debt instruments. This persistent situation pressures profits that banks can earn on loans.

Nvidia's earnings report next week could swing the overall stock market higher as Wall Street continues to focus on growth in artificial intelligence technology, according to Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster.
The chipmaker, which supplies processors that are key to AI development, will release second-quarter results after the close on August 23.
""We need to think a lot about Nvidia, because as Nvidia goes, so goes AI and so goes the Nasdaq,"" Munster told CNBC.
Shares were up 1.9% on Tuesday, bucking a broader stock market decline, and have soared more than 200% year to date. The Nasdaq has gained 30% this year, led by artificial intelligence stocks like Nvidia.
""All eyes are on their data center number,"" Munster added, noting that Wall Street's estimate for Nvidia's revenue from that segment is $8 billion. ""If they exceed that, that's going to send the broader market higher, the broader Nasdaq higher. If they come in line, that's going to be a disappointment.""
He agreed with a Morgan Stanley note Monday that predicted Nvidia will beat quarterly forecasts and raise guidance.
Munster also pointed out that Nvidia's CFO spoke at a conference in late June, just before management entered a quiet period leading up to the earnings report.
During the event, Nvidia highlighted strong demand worldwide and dismissed concerns about the effect of US-China trade restrictions, according to Munster.
""That's a pretty powerful comment going into the quiet period, and I think ultimately they are going to deliver on that,"" he said.
To put Nvidia's estimated data center revenue of $8 billion in the second quarter into more context, that would be up more than 110% from a year ago, he noted.

NVDA,2023-08-16 14:30:28,Nvidia is widely expected to have a blow out earnings report. A miss could derail the AI hype train.,"This article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe.
Nvidia (NVDA) will report its second quarter earnings after the closing bell next Wednesday, setting up what will be the AI hype cycle’s biggest test yet.
During this AI goldrush, companies around the world looking to profit have turned to Nvidia’s graphics processors to power new AI software and platforms.
Currently, tech firms of all sizes are doing everything they can to get their hands on Nvidia chips. During Tesla’s (TSLA) Q2 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk told analysts that the automaker will take as many Nvidia graphics processors as the company can produce.
That kind of demand is also why Nvidia blew away Wall Street’s expectations for its Q2 guidance during its last earnings call. At the time, analysts were anticipating revenue of $7.2 billion, but Nvidia said it will bring in around $11 billion in the quarter — a 64% jump over a year ago — which Wall Street analysts now expect next week.
Earnings-wise, the street also expects $2.07 earnings per share, a 306% year-over-year increase. Nvidia is used to enormous numbers, but these are putting high expectations on next week’s report and the stock is already rising.
“What Nvidia reports in its upcoming earnings release is going to be a barometer for the whole AI hype,” explained Forrester analyst Glenn O’Donnell. “I anticipate that the results are going to look really outstanding, because demand is so high, and that means Nvidia is able to command even higher margins than it would otherwise.”
But those sky high expectations mean if the company doesn’t deliver, it could put a serious damper on the AI explosion and send a shock through AI trades ranging from Microsoft and Google to Meta and AMD.
Wall Street is all in on Nvidia
At the start of trading in New York on Tuesday, Nvidia’s stock hit $445. Year-to-date, shares of the company are up a staggering 204%. And Wall Street analysts are still upgrading the stock.
In a research note Tuesday, Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo increased his price target on Nvidia from $450 to $500. Baird’s Tristan Gerra moved his price target on the stock from $475 to $570, adding that, “AI demand is surging at all levels: individuals, enterprise, hyperscalers.”
Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offered a similarly rosy view of the company, writing in a research note that “NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters; we think the recent selloff is a good entry point.”
UBS’s Timothy Arcuri also raised his price target on Nvidia, writing in a note that the company is, “quite literally serving as ‘kingmaker’ as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.”
Nvidia is the preeminent maker of both the high-powered graphics chips needed to run AI programs and the software needed to develop those AI platforms. And the company has been preparing for this moment for years, researching and working on its AI capabilities well before Wall Street jumped into the AI craze with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI platform in late 2022.
Since then Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and a cadre of AI-adjacent companies have positioned themselves as AI powerhouses.
Nvidia is mighty, but not invincible
While Nvidia is helping to drive the AI train, it’s facing a major problem at the moment. It simply can’t deliver as many chips as its customers want.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), is Nvidia’s go-to for building its chips, but the manufacturer’s capacity is stretched as orders continue to pile in from Nvidia. According to Arcuri’s note, the recent demand spikes have pushed lead times for Nvidia’s critical H100 chips to six to nine months.
During Tesla’s earnings call Musk said Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla’s orders, Nvidia can’t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires. As a result, Tesla is building its own supercomputer using its own AI chips to meet its needs.
Nvidia isn’t just facing increased lead times for its AI products, it’s also looking to keep competitors Intel and AMD off of its back. While the company has built up a lead thanks to its early investments in AI, the semiconductor business is notoriously competitive, and, as Intel has shown, no industry lead is safe.
“Nvidia is not invincible,” O’Donnell said. “Other companies like AMD and Intel and so on could come along and will come along and steal some of that share. But Nvidia has so much momentum right now that it is going to be hard to stop them. Not impossible, but hard.”
Now we just have to see what Nvidia has up its sleeve when it reports its earnings on Aug. 23.

NVDA,2023-08-16 16:41:31,"Michael Burry has repeatedly sounded the alarm on stocks, and said the passive-investing boom could lead to a worse disaster than the dot-com crash.","Michael Burry bet against two ETFs that track the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 last quarter.
The ""Big Short"" investor held bearish put options on the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ in June.
Burry has sounded the alarm on the stock market and flagged the risks of index funds.
Michael Burry disclosed sizable bets against the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 in his latest portfolio update. The wagers won't surprise his close followers.
Burry's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options on 200,000 shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust — an exchange-traded fund that tracks the benchmark US stock index — at the end of June, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed on Monday.
The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame also disclosed puts on 200,000 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100. The combined notional value of the two positions was a hefty $1.6 billion on June 30, but Burry's options will have cost him a fraction of that amount.
The two holdings could be hedges, intended to soften the blow to Scion's portfolio if the stock market slumps and its long positions tumble in value. But they could also signal that Burry is pessimistic about the two index funds, which are dominated by aggressively valued stocks like Tesla and Nvidia.
The Scion chief has been ringing the alarm on stocks and other risky assets for a while. For example, he diagnosed the ""greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things"" and predicted the ""mother of all crashes"" in the summer of 2021.
He suggested last spring that the S&P 500 might only bottom about 1,900 points — a 57% drop from its current level — if it followed the pattern of past crashes. He indicated last summer that the Nasdaq Composite could nosedive to 6,000 points, or about 56% from here, as valuation multiples shrank and corporate profits declined.
Burry has also called out the passive-investing boom in recent years. He labeled it a ""bubble"" in 2019, and said in 2021 that the flood of millennial money into index funds and ETFs was driving stocks to dangerous highs.
In October, he said the trend was laying the groundwork for a greater disaster than the dot-com crash, and enormous losses for investors.
""Difference between now and 2000 is the passive investing bubble that inflated steadily over the last decade,"" he tweeted. ""All theaters are overcrowded and the only way anyone can get out is by trampling each other. And still the door is only so big.""
It's worth noting that Burry said he was ""wrong to say sell"" this spring, and has bought a range of stocks in recent quarters. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 have surged by about 16% and 38% respectively this year, and aren't far off their all-time highs.
Given Burry's past doubts about stocks and dire warnings of epic crashes, it's quite possible he's bearish on the indexes and betting they'll collapse.",'Big Short' investor Michael Burry's new bets against the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 are no surprise.

Stocks wavered between losses and gains Wednesday as investors sifted through the latest batch of retail earnings and looked ahead to the mid-afternoon release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting.
On the earnings front, quarterly results from Target (TGT, +2.9%) led the headlines today. The discount retailer disclosed lower-than-anticipated second-quarter revenue of $24.8 billion, while same-store sales fell by a wider-than-expected margin. TGT also lowered its full-year forecast.
On the plus side, however, earnings of $1.80 per share came in above estimates, which CEO Brian Cornell called ""meaningful,"" particularly amid the ""softening sales trends"" seen early in the quarter. Additionally, the company's inventory level was 17% below where it was in Q2 2022.
""The key takeaway from the retailers is that the U.S. consumer is still healthy, maybe a little pickier and price sensitive, but still likely to continue spending well into Q3,"" says Edward Moya, senior market strategist at currency data provider OANDA.
Analysts eye more upside for Nvidia
Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) fell 1.0% even as Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri reiterated a Strong Buy rating on the semiconductor stock and raised his price target to $500 from $450.
The company is on next week's earnings calendar, set to disclose its fiscal second quarter results after Wednesday's close. Pajjuri is anticipating a beat-and-raise report, which should create tailwinds for the stock. ""We believe GPU demand is significantly outpacing supply on [the] AI spending boom despite mixed Cloud capital expenditure trends,"" the analyst says.
For what it's worth, the highest price target for the trillion-dollar tech stock is $1,000, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, while the lowest is $211.67. This works out to an average price target of $516.59, which represents implied upside of 19% over the next 12 months or so.
Fed minutes in focus
However, it was the release of the July Fed meeting minutes that was the main event today. The minutes showed that ""most survey respondents"" expected the quarter-point rate hike in July ""would be the last of this tightening cycle,"" although additional increases were possible. This is particularly notable given that participants ""stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high.""
Still, ""the probability of avoiding a recession through 2024 grew noticeably,"" the minutes stated.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5% at 34,765, the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower at 4,404, and the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.2% at 13,474.

That comes from the head of Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which is the world's biggest stock investor.
The fund made $143 billion in the first half of the year, helped by top US tech stocks.
Norway's sovereign wealth fund is bullish on artificial intelligence, with the nascent technology contributing to the portfolio's big gains this year.
The $1.4 trillion fund, which is also the world's single biggest stock market investor, has returned 10% year to date, amounting to about $143 billion.
The gains were fueled by US tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, which have benefited from hype over artificial intelligence.
In fact, those ""magnificent seven"" stocks accounted for about a third of the fund's recent gains and 12% of its holdings.
""If you don't think there are opportunities with AI, then in my mind you are a complete moron,"" Nicolai Tangen, the fund's chief executive, told the Financial Times.
He also said the fund is ramping up engagement with companies in its portfolio on artificial intelligence to ensure accountability on each board of directors.
""Boards are absolutely not on top of this,"" Tangen told the FT, adding that any companies lacking in AI expertise on the director level wouldn't get the fund's support.
Meanwhile, he warned that regulating AI will be difficult because the US-China rivalry has made the technology critical to the ""weapons race, medical race, self-driving race, financial race.""
But even as the fund has notched big gains this year on the back of tech stocks, Tangen said at a briefing Wednesday that it recently reduced its overweight position in top tech companies.
Tech holdings were about 12% of the fund's total value at the end of 2022, representing the largest sector of its equity investments.
""We are always conscious and worried about the biggest exposures of the fund,"" Tangen told Reuters separately. ""Now they are in the tech sector.

As investors begin to see light at the end of the tunnel, their risk appetite, which had vanished amid recession risks and volatility, is coming back, creating chances of major investments in high-risk, high-reward sectors like biotechnology. But so far in 2023, the biotechnology sector hasn’t seen much improvement in terms of stock performances, despite major news and M&A activity. Both the S&P Biotech ETF and Nasdaq Biotechnology Index are trading in the red as of August 4, as compared to S&P 500’s strong performance in the same period. The biotech industry remained in the headlines this year amid new weight loss products, Alzheimer’s’ treatments, Pfizer’s $43 billion offer for Seagen, Merck’s $11 billion buyout of Prometheus Biosciences, among several other smaller deals.
AI in Biotech?
AI is also having an effect on the industry. Recently, Recursion Pharmaceuticals announced that it will receive $50 million in investments from Nvidia to accelerate the biotech company’s drug discovery platforms using AI. Recursion will use Nvidia DGX Cloud and its own 23-petabyte dataset of biological and chemical data to make drug discovery models. Recursion is just one of the many biotech companies using AI for drug discovery. Other companies are also finding opportunities in the biotech-AI space.
Schrödinger, for example, explained its AI-related drug discovery projects in its Q1 earnings call:
Why Aren't Biotech Stocks Moving?
And yet the biotech industry is failing to gain the momentum seen in other stocks, especially tech stocks. Talking to Bloomberg, Tim Opler, a managing director in health-care investment banking at Stifel, said that because of AI investors are more excited about technology stocks as they don’t want to miss the broader rally of tech stocks fueled by AI. That’s why most of the investments are going to AI instead of life sciences or biotech segments. Biotech stocks are also failing to gain traction because of a strict regulatory environment around drug prices, scrutiny of major deals between biotech companies and analyst warnings that we are still not out of recession risks.
When there’s volatility and everyone is tightening their belt, biotech companies struggle to thrive and usually become the biggest victims of cost cutting since their profits lie far in the future. A Bloomberg report cited data from Mizuho Securities analyst Mara Goldstein, who said that so far in 2023 a whopping 88 biotech companies have restructured, compared to 63 in the same period in 2022. A lot of companies had to forgo their clinical trials of experimental drugs to save cash.
But not all is bad in the industry. Many companies recently posted strong results from their clinical trials. Recently there were IPOs as well, including those of Apogee Therapeutics Inc., Sagimet Biosciences Inc. and Turnstone Biologics Co. According to Bloomberg, Christian Richard, head of public research at Samsara Biocapital, believes these events will help the industry, but he still believes the sector needs more “thematic events” to cause a widespread rebound. Richard is also hopeful that new treatments for weight loss, immunologic disorders and Alzheimer’s disease will renew interest of investors in the sector.

A Test of Investors' Patience
There’s a reason why biotech is one of the sectors that suffer when financial markets face volatility. According to a report by S&P Global, investments in the biotechnology sector can test investors’ patience because it takes a long time for a new drug to the pharmacy shelf from test tube. There are many states in between these two stages, like make or break trials and studies, which always keep investors on their toes. The report also said that the biotech space is risky since chances of failure of new drugs are “exceptionally” high. The report also said that the discovery of new drugs is an “expensive, slow and risky business.”
The S&P Global report, which was published back in 2019, said that most of the biotech companies in the US were private and were funded by venture capital. However, it said that the number of publicly listed biotech companies was rising.

The so-called BRICS grouping gathers too amid increasing disquiet in some big emerging markets, while business activity data globally and China property woes mean August is proving far from dull.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Li Gu in Shanghai, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Jorgelina do Rosario and Marc Jones in London and Rachel Savage in Johannesburg.
1/ SUMMER CAMP!
U.S. Federal Reserve officials (plus friends from the ECB, BoE and BOJ) descend on Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Aug. 24-26 for their annual central bank confab.
A year ago, uncertainty swirled around how high the Fed would raise rates and whether aggressive tightening could defeat inflation without triggering recession.
Investors are more sanguine today, as expectations grow for a Goldilocks scenario of resilient growth and cooling price pressures.
That doesn't mean central banks are off the hook. Inflation remains sticky in places and investors want to know how long it will take for central banks to switch to easing. Bonds yields are rising again, threatening to dent stocks.
And on Wednesday, the spotlight turns to results from chip-maker Nvidia, whose stock is up almost 200% this year in-part on AI excitement.
2/ CHINA: HANDLE WITH CARE
Fresh strain in China's property market exacerbates the sense of crisis building in the world's No.2 economy.
The onus is on authorities to do more after an emergency rate cut failed to shore up sentiment. Yes, that move raised expectations for a cut to the loan prime rate - meaning lower mortgage rates - on Monday.
Yet, the measures investors are pining for include a relaxation of home-buying restrictions in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
Property accounts for roughly a quarter of the economy and news that new home prices fell for the first time this year in July is worrying.
Country Garden, once China's largest developer by sales, is teetering near default; a major Chinese trust company has failed to make payments on financial products following wrong-way property bets and embattled developer China Evergrande has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. Peak China pessimism, it appears, has not been reached yet.
3/ HOLD ON
Wednesday's August flash PMI business activity indicator, released across a host of economies, could throw cold water over optimism about resilient global growth and help traders get a sense of how long rates will stay high.
In July, a services sector slowdown pushed U.S. business activity to a five-month low; overall activity in the euro area contracted for the second-straight month.
Earlier in 2023, the services sector had supported economic growth across developed economies even as manufacturing slumped.
Input and output prices will also come under scrutiny as rising oil prices and strong labour markets suggest inflation is not contained yet.
European PMIs could provide a bigger signal on whether the European Central Bank will hike again in September and if the Bank of England opts for a big rate increase.
4/ BUILDING BRICS
Leaders of the 'BRICS' - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - meet Tuesday-Thursday in Johannesburg as they bid to turn the loose bloc into a global counterweight to the West.
Expansion is expected to be high on the agenda - some 40 nations have expressed interest in joining, either formally or informally, according to host South Africa. These include Saudi Arabia, Argentina and Egypt.
Not everyone is keen though, including Brazil, which is concerned its influence could be diluted. And Vladimir Putin, who will be videocalling in due to his international arrest warrant, has a headache back at home as a slumping rouble fuels speculation of tough new capital controls being introduced.
5/ GO BIG?
Turkey's central bank is poised to raise rates on Thursday for the third time in a row since Hafize Gaye Erkan was appointed as governor in early June.
The question is how big the hike will be as Turkey battles double-digit inflation. A policy U-turn at the last two meetings delivered rate increases that fell short of investors' expectations.
While the key rate stands at 17.5%, the consumer prices index leapt to a 25-year high above 85% last year and is expected to rise again to peak above 60% in 2024.
Erkan vowed in July to continue with ""gradual and steady rate hikes"" after years of President Tayyip Erdogan pushing for lower rates.
A big increase is unlikely to faze emerging market investors. Russia just jacked up its rates by 3.5 percentage points, and Argentina, a whopping 21 percentage points.

NVDA,2023-08-18 17:00:16,Stocks were set to continue an August swoon on Friday.,"Megacap stock losses approaching $1.5 trillion
Losses are mounting for some of the year's biggest gainers — the so-called Magnificent Seven — amid a rough August for the stock market.
All told, the market cap losses are closing in on $1.5 trillion.
Apple (AAPL) is sitting on the biggest loss from its 52-week high, which had the iPhone maker worth north of $3 trillion earlier this summer. The stock is now down 12.2%, or $379 billion in market cap, though it is still up about $689 billion year-to-date.
Microsoft (MSFT) is off a bit more in terms of its return, (down 13.6%), but has a smaller market cap loss of only $371 billion and is up $573 billion on the year.
Tesla (TSLA) is down more than 30% from its 52-week high, or about $300 billion, though it is holding on to $305 billion in gains this year.
Day trader favorite Nvidia (NVDA) is down nearly 10% with a market cap loss of $117 billion. The company will release a highly-anticipated earnings report next week.
Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) are the outliers, as neither has seen its market cap losses climb north of $100 billion. Alphabet stock is down 6.7% and Amazon stock is down 5.4% from their most recent highs, respectively.
Homebuyers find no relief as rates and prices climb
Prospective home owners hoping to catch a break on mortgage rate increases and elevated home prices will have to wait.
Homes are becoming less affordable on both fronts: The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed 7% in the past week, and some analysts no longer predict home prices will fall this year.
""We are revising our home price forecasts higher, to 1.8% for full-year 2023 vs. -2.2% prior, and 3.5% in 2024 vs. 2.8% prior,” Vinay Viswanathan, a fixed income strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note for the firm's housing team.
While rising interest rates typically put pressure on sellers to lower their prices, the tight housing supply and stronger than expected demand have kept prices high, reports Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero.
The homebuyers that have been diving into the challenging market are stretching their budgets in ways that may not be sustainable. The average debt-to-income ratio on conforming purchase mortgages is nearly 40%, ""a significant aberration from post-Global Financial Crisis averages,"" Viswanathan wrote.
The median existing-home sales price for June was $410,200, the second-highest price ever recorded since January 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors, behind only the peak of last summer.
Stocks trending in morning trading
Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page on Friday:
Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD): The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency was down more than 7% Friday morning, trading near $26,300, its lowest level since mid-June.
CVS Health (CVS): CVS stock rose 0.43% during morning trading Friday, halting heavy losses after Blue Shield of California parted ways with the pharmacy chain as its prescription drug benefit manager to instead pursue a partnership with Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Cuban's drug company.
VMware (VMW): The enterprise software company that is slated to be acquired by Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, sank just below the flat line after Broadcom secured up to $28.4 billion in new debt commitments to fund the purchase. The $61 billion deal would influence the massive market for enterprise computing.
Palantir (PLTR): Palantir stock rose 0.35% on Friday, claiming some lost ground following an 8% drop on Thursday. While the tech stock, like many of its industry peers, has suffered a rough several weeks, Palantir shares have more than doubled in value so far this year.",Stocks erase steeper losses as rough week comes to close: Stock market news today,433.435,432.98999,469.67001,8,2023,18

In the last 15 years, the S&P and Dow Jones indices have shown similar movement about 94% of the time, as monitored by CNBC. The S&P and NASDAQ have also exhibited synchronized movement about 92% of the time during the same period. However, in 2023, the NASDAQ has stood out by delivering a near 30% return. Meanwhile, the S&P has achieved a return of approximately 15%, and the Dow has lagged behind with a modest 5% gain as of August 18.
The recent remarkable performance of the NASDAQ can be attributed to the strong rally in tech and communications stocks. The major holdings of the index, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), have all achieved returns greater than 30% in 2023 so far. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) notably stands out with an impressive gain of 218%. However, it's important to note that the flip side is true as well – when investors divest from tech stocks, the impact can be devastating. During the dotcom bubble burst from 2000 to 2002, the NASDAQ experienced a substantial decline of 78%, in contrast to a 49% drop in the S&P 500 and 34% in the Dow.

The market capitalization of companies listed on the NASDAQ-100 has increased by close to $5 trillion since the beginning of this year. As indicated by past trends, the strong performance of the NASDAQ-100 so far suggests a positive outlook for the rest of 2023. The market's interest in generative AI has overshadowed potential negative headlines this year, such as recession fears, inflation, Fed rate hikes, geopolitical risks, debt-ceiling concerns, and regional bank failures. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television:
“I still do like big tech. I do believe in technology continuing to reinvent itself — obviously with the latest addition being AI. That’ll continue to drive earnings.”
Similarly, Sundeep Gantori, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, commented in July 2023:
“We don’t believe the AI trend is a bubble, but advise investors to be selective on AI-related stocks after the strong year-to-date rally. From a positioning point of view, we recently closed our self-help theme as we see better risk-reward in mid-cycle industries (software, internet) and tech laggards.”

“That balance served the Strategy well throughout the year, enabling outperformance against the benchmark in all four quarters. Results in the last three months were driven by a long-time media position in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which we consider a durable compounder due to its consistent revenue growth and free cash flow generation.

“The first is Sterling Construction Co., Inc. (STRL), which specializes in higher-margin work on highways, bridges, airports, water and sewer facilities, light-rail projects, flat concrete for subdivisions and foundations for data centers. For companies such as Sterling, we like to look at a metric known as EV (enterprise value) to EBITDA. Sterling’s EV to EBITDA ratio is about 7, which we think is inexpensive compared to competitors.

NVDA,2023-08-18 20:01:43,Stocks continued an August swoon on Friday.,"Stocks finish mixed and stumble through rough August
Wall Street finished the day with mixed results, as treasury yields remained near recent highs and uncertainty set in over the Fed’s interest rate policy. The optimism that fueled a summer rally has given way to concerns that central bankers will maintain higher rates for longer and may raise them again this year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.08%, or about 27 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just barely under the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 0.20%, marking its fourth consecutive daily loss. More than halfway through the month of August the Nasdaq has posted just three winning days.
The yield on 10-year treasuries (^TNX) fell to 4.25%.
Nvidia earnings highlight the week ahead
Second quarter earnings season is winding down, but a few marquee reports remain outstanding and none are bigger than results from Nvidia (NVDA) due out after the close on Wednesday.
In late May, Nvidia offered investors the highlight of the AI boom so far when they raised their current quarter revenue guidance by 50%. Ahead of these results, several Wall Street firms have raised expectations. The pressure will be on for Jensen Huang & co. to deliver with some of the heat coming off the Big Tech trade in August.
Retail sends conflicting signals of the resilient consumer
When it comes to consumer spending in America, it's a choose your own adventure story, but with economic data.
After Target slashed its full-year profit outlook, warning that rising interest rates, uncertainty over student loan repayments and general economic discomfort would continue to weigh on the company, Walmart wowed Wall Street. ""Our customers and members are resilient,"" said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. The retail giant reported big sales gains in stores and online, growing market share in groceries and raised their full-year guidance.
As Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports, the read from industry players on the clashing reports was ""another quarter where higher-income households traded down from Target and went to Walmart."" But the need to trade down wasn't apparent after looking at other categories of spending strength, like fast-casual restaurants, where Cava reported same store sales up 18.2%. ""People may be trading down, but they're still spending,"" Sozzi wrote.
For some analysts, however, even solid earnings from retailers gaining share from consumers trading down were not enough to offset the dangers to come. UBS analysts covering the discount department store Ross (ROST), which posted an earnings beat and raised its outlook, said in a note on Friday that they maintain a bearish view and believe a US recession will significantly weigh on Ross's sales and earnings. ""Wall St. doesn't realize how much pressure ROST's core consumer will continue to be under over the next 12-18 months. This will more than offset the benefit from trade down,"" the analysts said.
Crypto catches Wall Street’s sour mood
Wall Street’s sinking sentiment is contagious.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world's largest cryptocurrency, was down more than 7% Friday afternoon, trading below $26,000, matching lows not seen since mid-June, and wiping tens of billions of dollars off its market cap. The volatility ended what had been a sleepy summer for crypto investors. Major tokens stumbled, dragging down alt-coins, shares of the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and other digital asset companies like Marathon (MARA). Bitcoin's tumble led a crypto-wide fall of roughly 6.5%.
A host of factors have weighed on the digital currency, including increasing concerns about China's troubled economy and fears that the Fed might have future interest rate increases in store. As Wall Street sentiment sours around the potential for a prolonged period of higher rates, many investors have pulled back their money.
The price drop arrived amid a challenging regulatory backdrop for crypto. US financial regulators have claimed that two of the largest crypto exchanges in the industry, Binance and Coinbase, sold unregistered securities to the public.
Stocks trending in afternoon trading
Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page on Friday:
Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD): The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency fell more than 7% Friday afternoon, trading under $26,000, its lowest level since mid-June.
Ethereum USD (ETH-USD): Ether slipped 5%, sinking below a $200 billion market cap, and also retreating to two month lows.
Coinbase (COIN): Shares of the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US felt the pain of sinking crypto values and industry-wide pessimism, shedding 3%.
Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): Following bitcoin into the red, Marathon, the digital asset technology company, fell more than 8%, as the broader crypto industry pulls back.
Adyen (ADYEY): The Dutch payment company dropped nearly 4% after plunging nearly 40% a day earlier following a disastrous quarter that produces its slowest rate of growth and missed revenue estimates.
Applied Materials (AMAT): Shares rose 2% after the chip tool maker reported earnings that beat forecasts for both the top and bottom lines and raised its guidance on demand for artificial intelligence chips.
Megacap stock losses approaching $1.5 trillion
Losses are mounting for some of the year's biggest gainers — the so-called Magnificent Seven — amid a rough August for the stock market.
All told, the market cap losses are closing in on $1.5 trillion.
Apple (AAPL) is sitting on the biggest loss from its 52-week high, which had the iPhone maker worth north of $3 trillion earlier this summer. The stock is now down 12.2%, or $379 billion in market cap, though it is still up about $689 billion year-to-date.
Microsoft (MSFT) is off a bit more in terms of its return, (down 13.6%), but has a smaller market cap loss of only $371 billion and is up $573 billion on the year.
Tesla (TSLA) is down more than 30% from its 52-week high, or about $300 billion, though it is holding on to $305 billion in gains this year.
Day trader favorite Nvidia (NVDA) is down nearly 10% with a market cap loss of $117 billion. The company will release a highly-anticipated earnings report next week.
Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) are the outliers, as neither has seen its market cap losses climb north of $100 billion. Alphabet stock is down 6.7% and Amazon stock is down 5.4% from their most recent highs, respectively.
Homebuyers find no relief as rates and prices climb
Prospective home owners hoping to catch a break on mortgage rate increases and elevated home prices will have to wait.
Homes are becoming less affordable on both fronts: The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossed 7% in the past week, and some analysts no longer predict home prices will fall this year.
""We are revising our home price forecasts higher, to 1.8% for full-year 2023 vs. -2.2% prior, and 3.5% in 2024 vs. 2.8% prior,” Vinay Viswanathan, a fixed income strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note for the firm's housing team.
While rising interest rates typically put pressure on sellers to lower their prices, the tight housing supply and stronger than expected demand have kept prices high, reports Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero.
The homebuyers that have been diving into the challenging market are stretching their budgets in ways that may not be sustainable. The average debt-to-income ratio on conforming purchase mortgages is nearly 40%, ""a significant aberration from post-Global Financial Crisis averages,"" Viswanathan wrote.
The median existing-home sales price for June was $410,200, the second-highest price ever recorded since January 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors, behind only the peak of last summer.

CVS Health (CVS): CVS stock rose 0.43% during morning trading Friday, halting heavy losses after Blue Shield of California parted ways with the pharmacy chain as its prescription drug benefit manager to instead pursue a partnership with Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Cuban's drug company.
VMware (VMW): The enterprise software company that is slated to be acquired by Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, sank just below the flat line after Broadcom secured up to $28.4 billion in new debt commitments to fund the purchase. The $61 billion deal would influence the massive market for enterprise computing.
Palantir (PLTR): Palantir stock rose 0.35% on Friday, claiming some lost ground following an 8% drop on Thursday.

SYDNEY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Asian markets held their breath on Monday as investors waited to see how serious Beijing was about policy easing via widely expected rate cuts, having so far sorely disappointed with its stimulus steps.
China is expected to cut lending benchmarks by between 10 and 15 basis points on Monday, with many analysts predicting a big reduction to the mortgage reference rate to revive credit demand and shore up the ailing property sector.
The central bank on Sunday said Beijing would coordinate financial support to resolve local government debt problems, and there have been reports it was encouraging commercials banks to lend more.
Investors, however, would prefer massive fiscal spending to minor rate cuts and there is little sign of that as yet. The caution kept MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan near flat, having slid 3.9% last week to its lowest for the year so far.
Japan's Nikkei edged up 0.2%, but that follows a 3.2% slide last week.
S&P 500 futures were 0.1% firmer, while Nasdaq futures added 0.2%. Earnings from AI-darling Nvidia on Wednesday will be a major test of valuations.
Analysts are concerned the market has got too long, especially of tech, leaving it vulnerable to a deeper pullback.
BofA's latest survey of fund managers found sentiment was the least bearish since February 2022, while cash levels were at nearly a two-year low, and 3 out of 4 surveyed expect a soft landing or no landing for the global economy.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, argue there is still scope for investors to add to equity positions.
""The re-opening of the buy-back blackout window will provide a boost to equity demand in coming weeks although a flurry of expected equity issuance this fall may provide a partial offset,"" they wrote in a note.
Stock valuations have been pressured in part by a sharp rise in bond yields, with the U.S. 10-year hitting 10-month highs last week at 4.328%.
Early Monday, yields were holding at 4.253% and a break above 4.338% would take them to levels not seen since 2007.
Markets assume Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will note the jump in yields at the Jackson Hole conference this week, and the recent run of strong economic data. The Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracker is running at a heady 5.8% for this quarter.
""It's an opportunity for Powell to give an updated assessment on economic conditions, which now appear stronger than anticipated and reinforce the case for additional rate hikes,"" said Barclays analyst Marc Giannoni.
""Even so, we would be surprised if he provided specific guidance, with key August prints for employment, CPI and retail sales all to come before the September meeting.""
A majority of polled analysts think the Fed is done hiking, while futures imply around a 31% chance of one more increase by December.
The rise in yields has helped the dollar notch five weeks of gains and a nine-month top on the Japanese yen at 146.56. On Monday, it was trading at 145.32 with the market wary of risk of Japanese intervention.
The euro was also firm at 157.96 yen, but under pressure from the dollar at $1.0871 after losing 0.7% last week.
The ascent of the dollar and yields was weighing on gold at $1,888 an ounce, having touched a five-month low last week.
Oil prices have snapped a seven-week winning streak as concerns about Chinese demand offset tight supplies.
Brent was down 11 cents to $84,69 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 1 cent to $81.25 per barrel.
Prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) were underpinned by the risk of a strike at Australian offshore facilities that could affect around 10% of global supply.

Nvidia shares have nearly tripled in value this year, adding more than $700 billion to the company's market valuation and making it the first trillion-dollar chip firm.

(Reuters) - Nvidia investors expect the chip designer to forecast quarterly revenue above estimates when it reports results on Wednesday. Their only question is, by how much?
The company has been the biggest beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence apps, virtually all of which are powered by its graphics processors.
Nvidia shares have nearly tripled in value this year, adding more than $700 billion to the company's market valuation and making it the first trillion-dollar chip firm. They were up more than 2% in premarket trading on Monday.
The blistering rally in its shares means that Nvidia has little room for any earnings-related disappointment and anything other than a higher-than-expected forecast could trigger a rout in its stock, some analysts have warned.
The results could also dictate the direction of the wider market this week, as most of the S&P 500's gains this year have come from the AI-driven rally in Nvidia and Big Tech stocks.
""I've been covering tech since 1994 and I have never seen an environment where you are so dependent on one company to deliver,"" said Inge Heydorn, partner at GP Bullhound, which owns both Nvidia and AMD shares.
""AI is really the last pillar of growth and everybody is depending on it. If Nvidia shows weakness, we could be in for quite a substantial correction in the market.""
Wall Street expects the chip company to guide for a rise of about 110% in third-quarter revenue to $12.50 billion, according to Refinitiv. Nvidia has only forecast revenue below estimates once in the past two years.
Citi analysts said last week they were only modeling a revenue forecast of around $12 billion, but buy-side expectations have gone up to $14 billion.
At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock last week, pushing the median view to $500, which is 15.5% higher than its last close.
While the company's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio soared dramatically to more than 80 after its second-quarter revenue forecast of over 50% growth in May, it has come down since then as analysts raise their earnings expectations.
It now trades at nearly 40 times the consensus earnings for the next 12 months, much higher than AMD's 29.
Investors will be looking at sales at Nvidia's data center unit, home to its prized H100 chip used in AI, to see if the valuation can be justified.
SUPPLY-DEMAND DIVIDE
Analysts said Nvidia is able to meet only half the demand and its H100 chip is selling for double its original price of $20,000, adding the trend could go on for several quarters.
Still, there are some fears about growth as some of the demand surge is coming from China, where companies are stockpiling chips over worries about more U.S. export curbs.
""I don't think the risk of losing China business is incorporated in numbers and this is also somewhat disturbing the picture,"" Heydorn said.
The supply-demand divide could also lead some buyers to turn to rival AMD, which is looking to challenge Nvidia's most powerful offering for AI workloads with its M1300X chip.
""AMD's chips could be as much as 50% cheaper than Nvidia GPUs and somebody like Meta or Google may want to look at lowering their cost,"" Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar said .
AMD expects to start shipping the chip in the fourth quarter and could control roughly 10% of the AI chip market next year, analysts said.
But they warned AMD will face an uphill battle in catching up with Nvidia's software CUDA, which is already the industry standard in AI and has a major head start over the company's similar offering.
""Historically in semiconductors, the leader always has 70% or 80% share of the market but the customers always want to keep a second source around, so that the leader doesn't overcharge, and that second source here is AMD,"" Kumar said.

Aug 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Monday after a sharp selloff last week, with investors awaiting more clues on interest rates from an upcoming gathering of central bank policymakers at Jackson Hole, as well as quarterly results from Nvidia.
Strong gains in equities this year on signs of cooling inflation have come under test in August, with the S&P 500 losing more than 5% from its intra-day high in late July.
Fresh evidence of a robust U.S. economy last week yet again stoked expectations the Federal Reserve could keep rates higher for longer, driving the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level since October. If the yield on the 10-year note, last at 4.296%, crosses 4.338%, it would hit its highest level since 2007.
Investors are now keenly waiting for comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday at a meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming that begins on Aug. 24.
""The Jackson Hole symposium will be key to assess Powell's dovishness meter. If he raises concerns on the economic momentum or the rising credit risks, that may prompt the markets to price in rate cuts to start earlier,"" said Charu Chanana, a market strategist at Saxo Markets in a note.
Traders' bets of a pause in rate hikes in September stood at nearly 89%, according to the CME Group's Fedwatch tool. All three main U.S. stock indexes posted declines last week, led by the Nasdaq due to losses in major technology and growth stocks.
On Monday, bruised growth stocks edged higher, with Tesla rising 3.2% in premarket trading to lead the advance.
Nvidia, which sharply outperformed its megacap peers with gains of nearly 6% last week, climbed 2.2% as HSBC raised its price target on the stock to $780, the second highest on Wall Street.
The chip designer is expected to forecast quarterly revenue above estimates when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday. Nvidia earnings will be a major test for this year's stock market rally, which has been fueled by optimism around the potential for artificial intelligence.
At 7:06 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 112 points, or 0.32%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 20.25 points, or 0.46%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 89.75 points, or 0.61%.
Shares of Palo Alto Networks jumped 12.1% in premarket trading as the cybersecurity firm forecast annual billings above expectations. Shares of its peer CrowdStrike Holdings also gained 3.5%.
VMware gained 4.6% after UK's competition regulator cleared U.S. tech company Broadcom's $69 billion purchase of the cloud computing firm.

""Our choice of Friday has definitely made us the topic du jour these past two weeks and has made for some very interesting reading of all the analyst notes,"" Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora told analysts during a conference call on Friday.
""We apologize to people who are inconvenienced, but as we had mentioned in our press release, we wanted to give ample time to analysts to have one-on-one calls with us over the weekend, and we have a sales conference that kicks off on Sunday.
""So again, we apologize for the unique Friday afternoon earnings call, but clearly, we've enjoyed the attention.""
In early August, Palo Alto made a rare shift to announce earnings after the bell on a Friday, a move not seen by an S&P 500 company since Nike (NKE) in 2020. The stock had slumped nearly 20% on fears that bad news was coming from the company due to the adjusted earnings announcement date.
Palo Alto delivered fourth quarter revenue of $1.44 billion, above the $1.28 billion analysts had expected, while the cybersecurity company projected full-year billings in a range of $10.9 billion-$11 billion. The Street had been expecting $10.77 billion.
These upbeat results may also bolster sentiment around the AI narrative headed into Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which are expected on Wednesday after the bell.
In a note titled ""Flying over the firewall of worry"" — a nod to timing-related concerns around the company's results — Jefferies analyst Joseph Gallo maintained a Buy rating and $285 price target on the stock.
""Results/Guide were much better than feared & PANW remains our fav platform benefitting from cyber consolidation & AI,"" Gallo wrote.
Several Wall Street analysts had worried bad news may be coming from a Friday announcement.
And the concerns could've been warranted.
As Wall Street Horizon's vice president of research Christine Short highlighted in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, a late earnings announcement ""typically signals negative news on the horizon.""
Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives called the move ""one of the biggest PR disasters and black eyes we have seen in decades of covering tech.""
After the results and call came and went without disappointing news, analysts celebrated the beats and the company's artificial intelligence promise.
Meanwhile, UBS analyst Roger Boyd noted the Friday earnings date had his team fearing results could come in similar to fellow cybersecurity player Fortinet (FTNT), which is down nearly 30% since reporting disappointing results on August 3.
UBS cited industry partners which said Palo Alto had been ""chasing deals"" to the end the quarter in a fashion similar to Fortinet.
""While this is admittedly a small sample size, and you have to be careful not to extrapolate that comment or Fortinet's underwhelming results too much, we still think it's noteworthy, especially when you consider the unconventional timing of the earnings release on a summer Friday,"" Boyd wrote in an earnings preview on August 10.

Stocks are heading into a challenging week, with several significant events on the horizon. These include Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's forthcoming speech at a Fed symposium in Wyoming and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled to be released on August 23. Nvidia's projection of strong revenue growth in May was pivotal in driving the artificial intelligence rally that has propelled the S&P 500 Index's approximately 14% climb this year. Even though historical data suggests that the S&P 500 usually sees an increase in the week following the Fed symposium, options traders continue adding PUT options as a precaution against potential declines. Gold prices held above five-month lows on August 21 as investors turned their attention to the Jackson Hole central bankers' meeting. Spot gold increased 0.1% to $1,889.39 per ounce, with U.S. gold futures rising to $1,918.10. The focus is on U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, discussing whether elevated inflation justifies higher long-term equilibrium interest rates.
Goldman Sachs has lowered its China stock targets due to renewed concerns about the property sector, marking the second reduction in three months, reported Bloomberg. Economic pressures have led to fresh revisions in profit expectations. According to Goldman Sachs, Chinese stocks are expected to stabilize in a lower trading range than previous forecasts. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach until Beijing introduces more robust policy measures to address the risk of a property market decline. The bank has reduced its full-year earnings-per-share growth estimate for the MSCI China Index from 14% to 11%, and the 12-month index target has been revised down from 70 to 67, implying a 13% increase from the Friday closing level. On the oil front, prices have climbed for a third consecutive day due to indications of a tightening physical market and a pause in the dollar's recent surge. These factors have counterbalanced the growing concerns about demand in China and the US. Brent, the global benchmark, has surpassed $85 per barrel and has increased by over 2% since the previous Wednesday's closing. The oil market's upward momentum has been propelled by supply constraints enforced by major OPEC+ players Russia and Saudi Arabia since late June, while US crude inventories have declined to their lowest levels since January.
Meanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LITE), Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITRI), and American Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ:AMWD) are getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts. Check out the complete article to see the details of these and other stocks.

The average price target for the stock has been moving steadily higher recently, and is above $520, up from $505 just a week ago. The current target implies an upside of about 15% from current levels. Nvidia has risen 212% this year, compared with a gain of 39% for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Much of the rally reflects optimism over artificial intelligence, which Nvidia is a key player in.
HSBC, KeyBanc Capital Markets, and BMO Capital Markets are among the latest firms to boost their targets ahead of the Aug. 23 release of Nvidia’s second-quarter results. The report is expected to show significant demand for the chips used to process AI services. Revenue is seen rising 65% from the year-ago period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This is one of the first reports by Nvidia where AI is expected to be the primary focus. Generative AI services like ChatGPT were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year and the excitement surrounding applications of artificial intelligence buoyed stocks like Nvidia. Last quarter, Nvidia gave a forecast that was far stronger than expected, cementing its status of a primary beneficiary of spending on AI.
“Although market expectations have clearly risen for Nvidia and the overall AI supply chain, we expect bullish AI server momentum continued to surpass market expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee, who has a buy rating on the stock.
KeyBanc Capital Markets, meanwhile, expects Nvidia’s results and outlook will be “meaningfully above” consensus expectations, given strong demand trends.
Rosenblatt Securities, Piper Sandler, UBS, and Morgan Stanley have also lifted their targets recently.
The overall consensus on Nvidia is extremely positive, as nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock.

NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) -
European shares recovered from a six-week low and key U.S. treasury yields rose to decade highs on Monday as investors awaited a Federal Reserve meeting later this week.
Wall Street trading was mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial and the S&P 500 giving back earlier gains while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained on earnings optimism.
Global benchmark oil futures fell after rising $1 a barrel, under pressure from potential interest rate hikes and uncertainty around Chinese demand.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 121.76 points, or 0.36%, to 34,377.24, the S&P gained 9.62 points, or 0.22%, to 4,379.33 and the Nasdaq gained 127.27 points, or 0.96%, to 13,418.46 by 1:18 p.m. ET (1718 GMT).
The pan-European STOXX 600 ended higher, after rising as much as 0.9% intraday, recovering from Friday's six-week low. Energy and mining sectors gained, tracking higher crude oil and metals prices.
Germany's DAX rose 0.2% even as official data showed a higher-than-expected fall in German producer prices in July.
Adyen slumped 8.6% after two brokerages downgraded the Dutch digital payments firm's stock after the company missed half-year expectations on Aug. 17.
Earnings from AI-darling Nvidia on Wednesday will be another major test of valuations.
""Wall Street is having a hard time deciding what to do with stocks,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst with OANDA. ""Everyone is expecting an impact from the surge in yields, but it seems like tech companies have held up. Nvidia is going to be key.""
Longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields were up, with the 30-year yield hitting 4.468%, its highest since April 2011. Bond yields move inversely with prices.
The 10-year Treasury hit 4.35%, the highest since November 2007 - before the collapse of Lehman Brothers almost a year later fully ushered in the Great Financial Crisis.
""People are starting to get worried about the (bond) selloff and are looking ahead to (Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell and what he says later this week about peak rates,"" said Principal Global Investors' chief global strategist, Seema Shah.
The key event for the week is the Fed's Jackson Hole conference, where markets assume Powell will note the jump in yields and the recent run of strong economic data. The Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracker is running at a heady 5.8% for this quarter.
A majority of polled analysts think the Fed is done hiking, while traders are betting on a 40% chance of a final Fed hike by November.
CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK SURPRISES
Disappointment earlier weighed on Asian shares.
China's central bank trimmed its one-year lending rate by 10 basis points and left its five-year rate unmoved. That was a surprise to analysts who had expected cuts of 15 bps to both as recovery in the world's second-largest economy has lost steam due to a worsening property slump, weak spending and tumbling credit growth.
""The small injection of stimulus by China's central bank in the ailing economy has proved largely underwhelming given the scale of the challenges erupting across sectors, but it has given investors hope there could be more to come,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Analysts said concern around downward pressure on the yuan, which has lost nearly 6% against the dollar this year, is likely limiting the size and scope of rate cuts.
The European single currency was up 0.2% on the day at $1.0897, having lost 0.88% in a month, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was down at 103.32.
In commodities, spot gold prices rose 0.2% to $1,892.00 an ounce.
Brent crude fell 0.25% to $84.59, while U.S. crude futures rose 0.11% to $81.34 a barrel.

NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended more than 1% higher and the S&P 500 also rose on Monday, with shares of Nvidia jumping as investors were optimistic ahead of its earnings this week, and other technology-related stocks gaining.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended slightly lower.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes hit highs last seen during the Great Financial Crisis in 2007 as investors looked warily toward a meeting of central bankers who convene on Thursday at Jackson Hole in Wyoming. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on Friday.
The technology sector gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while an index of semiconductors advanced 2.8%.
Nvidia rose 8.5%, leading gains among semiconductor stocks, as HSBC raised its price target on the stock to $780, the second highest on Wall Street.
Nvidia, one of the biggest winners in this year's artificial intelligence tech stock rally, is expected to forecast quarterly revenue above analysts' estimates when it reports late on Wednesday. Nvidia's stock is up more than 220% for the year so far, while the Nasdaq is up 29%.
""Nvidia is considered the brand for AI,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Their targets have been lifted dramatically, so the question is, can they deliver... A catalyst coming in with Nvidia would be extremely helpful.""
At the same time, she said, investors are anxious to hear Powell's comments at Jackson Hole. Concerns the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer have pushed up U.S. Treasury yields, and fanned worries about the impact of higher rates on businesses and consumers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.97 points, or 0.11%, to 34,463.69, the S&P 500 gained 30.06 points, or 0.69%, to 4,399.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 206.81 points, or 1.56%, to 13,497.59.
Among decliners in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson shares fell 3% after the healthcare conglomerate said it was expecting to retain a stake of about 9.5% in its newly separated consumer health unit, Kenvue.
Goldman Sachs Group's stock dipped 0.9% after the bank said it was weighing the sale of a part of its wealth business.
Also in the tech space, Palo Alto Networks surged 14.8% after the cybersecurity firm alleviated worries about its late Friday release of results with a strong quarter and a forecast for annual billings above expectations.
And VMware jumped 4.9% after UK's competition regulator cleared Broadcom's purchase of the cloud computing firm. Broadcom's stock gained 4.8%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.75 billion shares, compared with the 10.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 214 new lows.

""I think the Fed might be worried something's going to break"" amid a renewed surge in interest rates, Lee said.
The stock market's 5% sell-off in August is likely to find its bottom this week and stage a rally amid two big market-moving catalysts, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.
The decline in stocks over the past few weeks has been driven by Fitch's downgrade of US debt, poor seasonality, and slowing economic data out of China. But those issues could soon be overshadowed by Nvidia and Jerome Powell.
In a Monday note, Lee highlighted that Nvidia's earnings report after the market close on Wednesday and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday represent big market-shaking catalysts that could spark a surge in stock prices.
""Stocks risk/reward has shifted positively this week. The key will be the direction of interest rates but we see positive catalysts emerging at the end of this week,"" Lee said.
For Nvidia, investors are eagerly awaiting its second-quarter earnings results three months after the company issued a jaw-dropping guidance update that catapulted its stock to a $1 trillion valuation. Lee expects good news from the company.
""We know Nvidia is going to have good results. We just know that they're selling every chip they produce,"" Lee said in a video update to clients. Lee expects the company to provide assurance to investors about the fast-growing artificial intelligence market, and that could help spark a rebound in technology stocks.
The second catalyst investors should watch this week is Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, which comes amid a renewed surge in interest rates. The 10-Year US Treasury rate is currently above 4.30%, its highest level in more than 15 years, while the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has solidly moved above 7%.
""We think the Fed is likely somewhat bothered by the rise in 10-year yields. This represents a meaningful tightening in financial conditions and threatens to push mortgage rates higher,"" Lee said.
The surge in interest rates comes at a time when inflation has made meaningful progress in moving lower, and it also triggers some painful memories back to February and March, when a surge in interest rates represented a breaking point for regional banks, with Silicon Valley Bank ultimately imploding.
""This 50 basis point surge in yields could trigger a financial problem somewhere,"" Lee said of the recent jump in interest rates, as it did earlier this year with the regional banking crisis.
Altogether, this could lead Powell to make some dovish comments during his Jackson Hole speech, along the lines of acknowledging that progress has been made on the inflation front and that perhaps the Fed is done, or almost done with its interest rate hikes.
""I think the Fed likely says something dovish-ish. Why? Does Fed want to risk another 'something breaking' ala February 2023?

NVDA,2023-08-22 00:28:33,Fairlead Strategies ultimately sees the current weakness in stocks as a buying opportunity after long-term momentum moved to the upside.,"The Nasdaq 100 just flashed a technical ""sell"" signal ahead of Nvidia's big earnings report, according to Fairlead Strategies.
The sell signal reflects a loss of momentum and suggests ""several weeks of corrective action, at a minimum,"" Fairlead's Katie Stockton said.
Stockton highlighted 13,834 as support for the Nasdaq 100, suggesting potential downside of 6%.
Technology stocks are poised for more downside after the Nasdaq 100 index flashed a technical ""sell"" signal, according to Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton.
In a Monday note, Stockton highlighted that the weekly moving average divergence-convergence, or MACD, indicator for the Nasdaq 100 flashed a ""sell"" signal on Friday. It's the first signal from the indicator since it flashed a ""buy"" signal on November 11.
The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that technical analysts use to show the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. A signal line is plotted, which can function as a buy and sell signal. Stockton uses MACD to capture momentum and trend across multiple timeframes. The indicator appeals because it's very black and white, generating either a buy, or a sell.
""This [MACD sell signal] tells us that the market may consolidate for several more weeks... The setup supports several weeks of corrective action, at a minimum,"" Stockton said.
The sell signal comes during a poor month for stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 down 6% in the month of August. And the signal comes just a few days ahead of Nvidia's highly anticipated second-quarter earnings report. The $1 trillion chip giant reports results after the market close on Wednesday and investors are expecting a massive boom in its AI chip business.
Stockton highlighted 13,834 as a key support level for the Nasdaq 100, which represents potential downside of 6% from current levels.
Putting pressure on tech stocks this month has been a surge in interest rates, with the 10-year US Treasury rate trading to 4.35% on Monday, representing its highest level since 2007.
""If we do see 10 year yields clear that 4.34% [level], the next resistance on the chart, which is the best way we have to understand upside, is about 5.25%, and that would be a near-term objective,"" Stockton told CNBC on Monday.
Such a move higher in interest rates would only put more pressure on stock prices. But Stockton ultimately sees the current weakness in stocks as a buying opportunity.
""I think we see this corrective phase as just that, a corrective phase, something that should yield a buying opportunity. It comes at a very normal sort of seasonal time for this kind of volatility,"" Stockton said. ""The long-term momentum has gradually shifted to the upside this year, so I think we'll at least have an opportunity to take advantage of that during Q4, even if it's not long lived.""",Tech stocks just flashed a 'sell' signal ahead of Nvidia's big earnings report,469.67001,456.67999,471.16,8,2023,22

India has imposed a 40% export tax on onions and plans to sell them locally at subsidized rates. The vegetable stands alongside tomatoes and potatoes as part of a trio of crops so crucial to Indian diets that past price spikes due to crop losses have prevented some ruling parties from returning to power. Consumers are more sensitive to onions — a vegetable that’s hard to be replaced with any other commodity in many local cuisines — than to tomatoes and potatoes.
The government faced fierce criticism after tomato prices rocketed as much as eight-fold following heavy rains in key growing areas. The cost of tomatoes has been falling, but a steady rise in onions put the authorities on high alert. The moves come as costs rise for many farm commodities, such as wheat and rice, because of poor weather.
Stable food prices are crucial for Modi, who will seek a third five-year term in national elections next year. Retail inflation is running at a 15-month high, underscoring the scale of the challenge. The government has curbed exports of wheat, rice and sugar, and may scrap a 40% tariff on wheat imports. It’s selling tomatoes and grain in the open market and curbed stockpiling of some crops.
“The government’s move on onions is preemptive in nature, as the price rise appears in line with seasonal trends for now,” said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays Bank Plc. “But with expectations of an erratic end to the monsoon season,” the government is focusing on the risk of food prices staying elevated in the coming months, he said.
El Niño Threat
An El Niño-induced spell of poor weather may hurt onion crops in the top growing state of Maharashtra, where precipitation is already below average. Monsoon rains overall in India have been about 7% below normal, helping push up food prices. Wheat has risen 12% in Delhi from a year earlier. Rice costs 22% more, tomatoes are up 80%, while onions have increased 32%.
Amar Kisan Jagtap, 44, who grows corn and onions on his six acres of land in Maharashtra, skipped growing onions during the monsoon. Jagtap plans to halve the onion area during the winter season as he anticipates more curbs ahead of some state polls this year and the general election in April or May of 2024.
“I will reduce plantings as my costs are rising every year, but we’re not able to get remunerative prices,” Jagtap said in an interview. “The government’s interference is very high in onions and the recent move to impose an export duty will put pressure on prices.”
Maharashtra is the country’s top producer of onions, accounting for more than 40% of output. They are grown three times a year, twice in the rainy season and once during winter. Rains in parts of the state have been 18% below normal, stressing crops and making the government nervous ahead of the polls.
“Obviously, elections are in focus,” Bajoria said. The “bulk of the food price spike in July was driven by vegetables that are perishable and seasonal in nature,” he said. “I would be more concerned about commodities such as rice and wheat that tend to be more sticky.”

Foreign funds are primary drivers of Chinese stocks’ recent selloff, said Li Bei, founder of Shanghai Banxia Investment Management Center. Overseas investors stirred up market volatility and, “taken together, they are a bunch of aimless flies,” she said in an article posted on social media platform WeChat.
Li’s comments came right after Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index and the onshore CSI 300 both set fresh 2023 lows. Doubts over China’s commitment to support its ailing housing market have been on the rise as the government refrained from pouring on mass stimulus. On Monday, mainland banks surprisingly kept a key interest rate tied to mortgages on hold.
Foreign investors had loaded up on mainland Chinese stocks following the Politburo’s pro-growth policy statement last month, but that buying spree proved fleeting. As of Monday, overseas funds had sold A-shares on a net basis via trading links for 11 straight sessions, a record selling streak since Bloomberg began tracking the data in December 2016.
That said, foreign funds have accounted for just around 6% of the total onshore turnover this year. Overall, they own less than 4% of total A-shares outstanding, according to a report this month from China International Capital Corp.
This isn’t the first time Shanghai Banxia Investment has pushed back against negative market sentiment. Last month, the firm joined a major lender and the state media in dismissing a bearish research report on Chinese banks by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Buying Opportunity
Li’s flagship Banxia Macro Fund ranks the best performer among multi-asset funds running at least 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) for the past five years, and is second for all hedge fund strategies as of May, according to Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co., which compiles results of Chinese hedge funds.
Initiatives to recharge shantytown redevelopment and address risks from local government financing vehicles are more effective in stimulating the economy than rate cuts, Li said. Based on the central bank’s recent policy moves and foreign funds’ retreat, it’s likely “another good buying point,” she said in the article.
Bloomberg News was unable to reach Banxia via phone outside of office hours.
Heeding calls from authorities to bolster the market, China’s largest mutual fund houses promised to buy their own equity-focused products. Meanwhile, state television CCTV said investors should be vigilant against commentary that dents confidence and disrupts market order.

After the offshore yuan weakened last week past 7.30 per dollar, just a stone’s throw from last year’s all-time low, the People’s Bank of China pushed back, with verbal warnings, urging dollar sales and following up with the biggest daily reference rate bias on record at the time for the managed currency.
While that appears to have slowed the momentum of the selloff, along with a welcome bout of broad dollar weakness, strategists say these stopgap measures aren’t enough to halt the yuan’s depreciation — a trend shaped by a weak economy and relatively low yields. Rate cuts have only widened the yield gap with the US, and the lack of any significant steps to boost consumer spending and a spreading crisis in the property sector further undermine investor confidence.
“The fundamental case for additional yuan weakness remains very much intact,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Meera Chandan, co-head of foreign exchange in London, wrote in a research report on Friday. “We see the dollar-yuan uptrend as durable, but recent events are a reminder that authorities will periodically try to disrupt one way moves.”
On Monday, funding costs in the offshore yuan market soared by the most in six years amid speculation that authorities are making it more expensive to bet against the currency. On Tuesday, China once again delivered its most forceful fixing on record, relative to market expectations.
Yuan Shorts Squeezed as Funding Costs Jump to a Five-Year High
The problem is, Chinese interest rates remain well below their US counterparts across tenors. Two-year Treasuries now yield about 290 basis points above Chinese government bonds of the same maturity, a level last seen in mid-2006.
While the offshore yuan only started trading in 2010, the comparable onshore currency at the time was trading near 8 per dollar. That would imply a roughly 9% downside for the Chinese currency if the yield gap is sustained, without allowing for other factors.
“We don’t think there is a hard line-in-the-sand for the exchange rate,” said Ju Wang, head of greater China FX & rates strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong. “Ultimately it depends on the yield difference between US and China, and we’re witnessing a nearly record widening of nominal rates differential.”
China’s central bank vowed to “step up macroeconomic policy adjustment” in its quarterly monetary report published on Thursday, reaffirming its accommodative policy stance. It also pledged to resolutely prevent excessive movements in the exchange rate.
The offshore yuan traded at 7.2870 per dollar Tuesday, not too far from the all-time low of 7.3749 reached in October. Earlier this year, it was trading around 6.70 amid hopes economic reopening would spur a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.
Christopher Wong, an FX strategist at OCBC in Singapore, said the market is closely watching whether “dollar-yuan will rise further to test the 7.38-41 resistance area.”
If that happens, it “may push markets to try and test higher possibly toward 7.50 within weeks,” Wong said.
To Craig Chan, Global Head of FX Strategy at Nomura Singapore Ltd., the persistent gap between the yuan’s daily fixing and market expectations may have already begun to undermine the stabilizing effect of the reference rate. Authorities may be forced to sell dollars if the gap approaches the 2% daily band, Chan noted.
In its biggest pushback against a weaker yuan via the so-called daily fixing, the PBOC set the rate for the managed currency about 1.5% stronger than the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey with traders and analysts.
“Regarding yuan depreciation, our conviction level is at a maximum 5 out of 5,” Chan said, adding dollar-yuan could possibly reach 7.50 and beyond. The biggest risk for beating on yuan weakness is a significant economic stimulus package out of Beijing, he said.
Still, the weakening yuan does come with some benefits for China, offering a leg up as the country battles deflation in stark contrast to many Group-of-10 economies.
“China needs to lower real rates right now,” Geoffrey Yu, senior strategist at BNY Mellon, said in an interview last week on Bloomberg Television. “That’s why they’re allowing the renminbi to depreciate, so they can import some inflation.”

The AI chip company has set high expectations after its May revenue guidance exceeded Wall Street estimates.
Here's what Wall Street expects from Nvidia's upcoming earnings report.
Nvidia will be closely watched by investors this week as the company gets ready to release its second-quarter earnings report after the market close on Wednesday.
The chipmaker blew away analyst expectations in May when it issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11 billion, which exceeded Wall Street estimates by a massive $4 billion.
The company, which manufactures and sells GPUs that help power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, has seen soaring demand for its products over the past few months, and it commands a decisive lead in the AI chip market.
""We're using a lot of Nvidia hardware. We'll actually take it as fast as they'll deliver it to us. Frankly, if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so many customers,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call in July.
The boom in Nvidia's AI-focused business has sent its stock price soaring more than 200% year to date, giving it a $1.1 trillion market valuation.
Most of Wall Street expects Nvidia to continue impressing investors with solid second-quarter results, and even better-than-expected guidance for the second half of the year. The average EPS estimate for the quarter is $2.07, and the average revenue estimate is $11.2 billion, according to data from YahooFinance.
Here's what the Wall Street analysts are saying about Nvidia's upcoming earnings report.
Barclays: 'Nvidia remains our preferred exposure to AI.'
""Our backend Asia checks show Nvidia backend can support up to $15 billion in H100/A100 revenue in Q3 and more in Q4, leaving potential for more substantial beats and raises over the next few quarters,"" Barclays said in a note late last month, referring to Nvidia's GPUs
""The consensus total Data Center estimate (including Mellanox) for Q3 is just $8.5 billion... AMD looks positioned within the market as the potential first viable competitor, but we likely won't even see initial signs of success until next year. In the meantime, Nvidia will continue to take the lion's share of the economics from the AI boom.""

Bank of America: 'From shock-and-awe to consolidate-and-advance.'
Nvidia is a ""top sector pick ahead of its F2Q earnings call given its dominant position and multi-year runway in transforming the $1+ trillion in traditional global data centers to AI/accelerated compute.

""Nvidia is unlikely to guide beyond a quarter, but listen for management commentary around continued sales acceleration/early in ramp etc. Post-earnings reaction could see some near-term stock consolidation following the 200%+ move up YTD (vs SOX up 46%),"" BofA said.

Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index rose Monday for its first gain in five days as tech stocks rallied.
Traders hope officials at the Fed's summer Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference say they are finished raising interest rates that are at a two-decade high. But forecasters warn they might say inflation isn't under control yet.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell “may even mention that further rate hikes cannot be entirely ruled out,” said Clifford Bennett of ACY Securities in a report.
The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.8% to 31,802.54 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 0.2% to 17,653.43. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1% to 3,090.13.

After a stifling August so far, world markets caught some relief on Tuesday as this month's bond squeeze eased a bit - with investors now awaiting signals from Wyoming and distracted by hopes of a reprise of the early-year AI craze.
There was little to trigger the bounce, other than U.S. 10-year Treasury yields being dragged back from 16-year highs of 4.36% ahead of Thursday's annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole - at which some indications of longer-term Fed policy thinking is eyed.
No news proved good news in China - where the relentless stream of negativity around the country's spluttering economy and ailing property sector seemed to dry up as President Xi Jinping attended the BRICS summit in South Africa. The onshore yuan steadied amid supportive action by China's state banks in the swaps market, and Chinese stocks perked up from the year's lows.
But the global rebound was first seeded on Wall St on Monday as tech stocks got a lift ahead of chip giant Nvidia's quarterly results on Wednesday, with hopes of some refocus on the artificial intelligence boom that's already lifted Nvidia's stock 220% for the year to date. The Nasdaq 100 clocked its first gain in a week, adding 1.6% for its biggest rise of the month, and the S&P500 also notched its first advance in five.
Overall, MSCI's all-country index was on course on Tuesday for its first back-to-back daily gains of August so far. And S&P futures were up ahead of the bell.
Even though Treasury yields hit new cycle highs in Asia trading, there was some demand at those levels as investors await the Jackson Hole event and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's keynote speech there on Friday. The dollar eased back in line with the retreat in yields too.
Futures markets are now see a 50-50 chance of another Fed hike next month given the recent strength of the economy - but the focus this week may well be on how long rates stay at these levels and whether estimates of long-term sustainable interest rates have risen.
There were background concerns about the impact on U.S. banks of this latest hit to bond prices and borrowing rates.
Credit-rating firm S&P Global late on Monday cut ratings and revised its outlook for multiple mid-tier U.S. banks, following a similar move by Moody's, and warned funding risks and weaker profitability will likely test the sector's credit strength.
And U.S. government spending curbs were also set to come back into focus in Congress next month, with the outside chance of a government shutdown as Republican factions push for more cuts beyond what was agreed to raise the debt ceiling in May.
Elsewhere, investors were enthralled by plans by SoftBank's chip designer Arm for the biggest initial public offering of the year - even after reporting 1% fall in annual revenue.
And ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision will sell its non-European streaming rights to Ubisoft Entertainment to get the biggest deal yet in video-gaming past British regulators, potential owner Microsoft said on Tuesday.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A scramble among Arm Holdings Ltd's clients, comprising the world's biggest technology companies, to snap up shares in its initial public offering (IPO) is testing the semiconductor designer's adherence to not picking sides in the chip industry.
Customers of Arm that have held talks about taking a piece of the IPO include Apple, Amazon.com, Intel, Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft , Samsung Electronics and TSMC, Reuters has reported. Arm is hoping for a valuation of up to $70 billion in the IPO, which will launch on the Nasdaq next month.
These companies' interest is fueled by a desire to expand their commercial relationship with Arm, and make sure that their rivals do not gain an edge, according to people familiar with the discussions.
This is because Arm's customers view its semiconductor designs as an indispensable resource. They are used by more than 260 technology companies to make over 30 billion chips annually, powering 99% of the world’s smartphones and everything from the tiniest of sensors to the most powerful supercomputers.
While an IPO investment would not come with a seat on Arm's board or ability to dictate strategy, it could strengthen ties with each participating company and make it harder for a competitor to acquire Arm later, according to the sources.
""These guys want to be able to feed their technology needs back into Arm, so that their needs get put into Arm's intellectual property,"" said Jack Gold, founder of technology consultancy J. Gold Associates.
Arm and its owner SoftBank Group have set aside 10% of the shares to be sold in the IPO for its clients, the sources said. They have pushed back against demands for higher allocations, arguing this would weigh on the liquidity of Arm's stock, given that shares totaling a stake of only 10% in Arm will be sold in the IPO, the sources added.
Arm and SoftBank declined to comment.
The details of the IPO discussions between Arm and its clients, which have not been previously reported, illustrate how the company's neutral status as ""the Switzerland of chips"" remains a flash point. SoftBank is pursuing the IPO because its attempt to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40 billion collapsed last year after other chip makers, who were clients of Arm, complained to antitrust regulators about it.
Nvidia is a major customer of Arm, licensing its technology to power a new processor for data centers that could win it market share against longtime rivals such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
Nvidia declined to comment.
APPLE, SAMSUNG
Another of Arm's major customers in talks to invest in the IPO is Apple. It was part of a consortium that founded Arm in 1990, and has been using its technology for chips that power its iPhones and Mac computers. Its close relationship with Arm has helped it design chips that curbed its reliance on Intel as a supplier.
Apple spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
In its relationship with Arm, Samsung has also been motivated by its desire to have more autonomy and fewer costs in its production of smart phones. The Korean company and its executive chairman Jay Lee have cultivated ties with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to the sources. Son was born in Japan but has Korean ancestors.
Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.
Intel has turned to Arm mostly to make custom networking chips. But as it expands its foundry business to compete in the contract manufacturing of chips against TSMC, it needs a closer relationship with Arm to ensure it can produce Arm-based chips for customers.
An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.
Many technology companies that seek to make their own chips using Arm's designs turn to TSMC for its low-cost manufacturing. This has motivated TSMC to advance the adoption of Arm's designs.
TSMC did not respond to a request for comment.
AMAZON, ALPHABET, MICROSOFT
Amazon has used Arm to develop its own chip called Graviton to power the servers behind its cloud business and reduce its reliance on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices for chip supplies. It is seeking to expand the relationship as it develops more hardware, the sources said.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.
Alphabet and Microsoft trail Amazon in developing self-sufficiency in chips but are following suit. Alphabet is keen to secure supplies for its Pixel line of Android phones, while Microsoft wants to ensure compatibility with its Windows platform.
Alphabet and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.
None of these companies' investments in Arm's IPO are certain. SoftBank recently valued Arm at $64 billion in a transaction with its Vision Fund, and it is possible that some companies will balk at the price expectations.
""The valuation seems kind of high and people are awaiting what valuation comes in at,"" said Dylan Patel, chief analyst at semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis.

""It might be the most important report of this earnings season. We want to hear that they can build on the amazing quarter they had last quarter,"" said Dennis Dick, market structure analyst at Triple D Trading.
The company had in May forecast second-quarter revenue that was more than 50% above expectations. That pushed its market capitalization above $1 trillion, making its stock the best performer on the S&P 500 index.
Nvidia's blowout forecast last quarter had also sparked a rally in AI-stocks as well as Big Tech, making it one of the key drivers for the U.S. stocks rally this year.

At least 19 brokerages have this month raised their target price on Nvidia, pushing the median view to $500, which is a 6.5% increase to stock's last closing price. Nvidia has more than tripled in value so far this year.

Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures advanced on Tuesday as optimism around Nvidia's keenly awaited earnings report kept megacap growth stocks on a strong footing, while easing yields on longer-dated government bonds also provided some support.
After sharp losses in the previous week on worries over higher-for-longer interest rates and a surge in Treasury yields, U.S. equities regained some ground on Monday due to a rally in Nvidia and other tech stocks ahead of the chip designer's second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
Shares of Nvidia climbed 1.7% in premarket trading on Tuesday after adding nearly 9% in the previous session and closing about 2% short of their all-time high of $480.88.
Other big technology and growth stocks also rose, with Tesla advancing 3.4% after logging its biggest one-day percentage gain since March on Monday.
Investors will be keen to see if Nvidia's results can match up to heightened market expectations following a blockbuster report last quarter that fueled a blistering rally in tech stocks amid the frenzy around artificial intelligence.
""A very high bar is being set for the chipmaker and the disappointment could be amplified if it falls short of heightened expectations,"" said AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould.
Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped from a 15-year high of 4.35%, helping release some pressure off equities.
The recent selloff in bonds was driven by evidence of a strong U.S. economy, which dampened hopes of the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy anytime soon.
A meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, which starts on Thursday, will be closely monitored by investors for more clues on the direction for U.S. interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the meeting will grab the spotlight on Friday.
Traders' bets of a pause in rate hikes next month stand at 86.5%, while odds of a 25 basis point rate hike in November have risen to nearly 39% from about 35.8% a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Quarterly results from a number of consumer goods makers were also in focus on Tuesday. Lowe's Cos rose 3.2% after the home improvement retailer topped quarterly profit estimates.
Macy's jumped 4% after the department store chain beat second-quarter sales estimates, while Coty slipped 2.0% after the perfume and cosmetics maker forecast annual profit below Wall Street expectations.
At 7:08 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 66 points, or 0.19%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.39%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 79 points, or 0.53%.

NVDA,2023-08-22 12:22:53,The bulls on Nvidia should keep something in mind: product availability.,"The bulls are so blinded by the AI hype around Nvidia (NVDA) ahead of its earnings this week, they may be forgetting one important ingredient to the story.
If Nvidia can't make enough of its hot-in-demand AI chips that power large language models, then it probably can't meet the ever-rising profit expectations of Wall Street. And if that's the case, the Nvidia hype balloon may pop.
""Nvidia expectations have been steadily moving higher in recent weeks, and the investor debate appears centered on supply rather than demand,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy pointed out in a new client note on Tuesday.
Roy added that supply concerns and its near-term impact on Nvidia's guidance are ""top of mind.""
Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).
The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24. Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.
Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.
Nvidia's shocking May outlook has Wall Street bracing for big, positive guidance from the company when it reports earnings on Aug. 23.
HSBC, KeyBanc, and BMO Capital Markets are the latest investment banks to raise their price targets on Nvidia into second quarter results. And Wells Fargo, Baird, and Morgan Stanley got the pre-earnings excitement going with bullish notes of their own last week, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reported.
""Last quarter's guidance was pretty astonishing,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""I had to look at the number twice. I couldn't register it in my brain, and I've been doing this job a fairly long time. I've never seen a guide like that from an established, at-scale company like we saw. So that was pretty unbelievable.""
Nvidia stock is up 15% in the last week alone, bringing the year-to-date gain to 221%.
But chip supply uncertainty must at least be acknowledged by the Nvidia bulls, as it's very real.
VentureBeat reported that power players in tech such as Oracle (ORCL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) may want hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's H100 chips. The insatiable demand for the chips is spurring shortage fears in Silicon Valley, and possibly limiting Nvidia's top line in the near-term
""Who’s getting how many H100s and when is top gossip of the valley [right now],"" posted tech insider and top data scientist Andrej Karpathy on X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier this month.
Nvidia bull Rasgon acknowledged the problem as a top risk too.
""Supply is very limited, so customers can't get what they want,"" Rasgon explained. ""And there's a general behavior that happens in semiconductors and lots of other places, it's called double ordering. When people can't get what they want, they order more.""
""And with Nvidia, that's one of the primary controversies is this new level of demand that we see, is that sort of the new baseline for growth? Or is it like pull forward and panic buying and is there an air pocket?"" Rasgon continued. ""And look, at some point, what is the chance that Nvidia will see an air pocket? It's probably 100%. We've seen them before. We'll see it again.""

S&P downgrades multiple US banks on growing liquidity worries
A relentless rate-hike campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised deposit costs at banks, which have been forced to pay out higher interest to keep depositors from fleeing to other high-yielding alternatives. S&P on Monday cut its ratings on Associated Banc-Corp and Valley National Bancorp on funding risks and higher reliance on brokered deposits, while UMB Financial Corp, Comerica Bank and KeyCorp were downgraded, citing large deposit outflows and prevailing higher interest rates.

Stocks Struggle as Nvidia Drops in Earnings Run-Up: Markets Wrap
Half a Million US Jobs at Risk of Vanishing in Payroll Revision
The fitness company is kicking off a new college strategy that includes co-branding of apparel and bikes, discounts on its app for students, and social media campaigns that feature athletes. Michigan will be the first such partnership — a deal that includes replacing the current bikes at the school’s football stadium, known as the Big House, with Peloton equipment.
The agreement follows a push to sell more Peloton equipment and services to businesses. The company unveiled a business-to-business program last week, aiming to work with employers to offer Peloton as a perk to workers. It’s also looking to get more Peloton bikes into places like hotels, apartment buildings and local gyms.
After a rocky couple of years, the New York-based company is trying to rely less on the home-fitness buffs that initially made its stationary bikes a hot commodity. Peloton saw demand surge during the early days of the pandemic, only for sales to slump after people began returning to offices and gyms. The company is expected to report its sixth straight quarter of declining sales when it posts results on Wednesday.
Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy — a veteran of Netflix Inc. and Spotify Technology SA — took the helm last year and has been trying to turn Peloton around. His overhaul has included layoffs, management changes and offloading businesses.
Expanding into colleges brings an opportunity to sell both to students and well-heeled alumni. With the Michigan partnership — negotiated by the sports marketing firm Learfield — Peloton will support football, basketball and hockey, as well as Olympics-bound athletes. The company will provide fitness instruction and in-venue activations of Peloton services.
Peloton bikes in Michigan colors — blue and maize — will be visible on the sidelines of football games. And the company will be sponsoring the “Maize Rage” student cheering section at men’s and women’s basketball games. Students will be able to get Peloton’s App One for $6.99, rather than the usual $12.99.
The company also will launch social media campaigns featuring student-athletes — with an eye toward getting its brand in front of more Gen Z consumers.
“Gen Z is a very attractive audience for us,” said Greg Hybl, general manager of Peloton for Business. “Any opportunity to get in front of them while they’re in college — it is really appealing to us.”

Stocks Fail to Catch a Bid Before Nvidia’s Results: Markets Wrap
Shares opened higher and climbed as much as 2.6% to hit an all-time intraday high of $481.87, the latest sign of investor optimism ahead of the results. However, they turned lower and ended the session down 2.8%. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 0.2%.
Still, the stock remains 12% higher from a low hit earlier this month, and has surged 212% this year, making it by far the biggest gainer among constituents of the S&P 500 Index. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is up 39% in 2023.
In a sign of how significant Wednesday’s report will be, the options market is bracing for a move of 9.8% following the results. With Nvidia accounting for nearly 3.1% of the S&P 500, the stock’s move will have broader implications.
Of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500, Nvidia is the only stock for which the price of call options — which are desirable if the stock goes up — is higher than put options, according to data from Nations Indexes.
“It tells me that people are still scrambling to buy calls in Nvidia,” said Scott Nations, president of Nations Indexes. “They still want upside much more than they’re worried about downside protection. That is an outlier in the biggest names in the S&P.”
The stock’s 2023 rally reflects optimism over artificial intelligence, which Nvidia is a key player in, and the Tuesday record is the latest example of how investors have been piling into the stock ahead of second-quarter results due after the market closes on Wednesday.
Nvidia gained 8.5% on Monday as analysts raised their price targets and expressed optimism that the report will show massive demand for the chips used to process AI services. Generative AI services like ChatGPT were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year and the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence applications lifted a number of megacap technology and internet stocks.
Last quarter, Nvidia gave a forecast that was far stronger than expected, cementing its status as a primary beneficiary of AI spending. The upcoming report will provide new details on whether demand is holding up enough to justify the stock’s surge. Revenue is seen rising 65% from the year-ago period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors are “looking for continued outsized growth despite supply constraints” for graphics processing units and will want to see “a timeline for supply-demand balance regarding GPUs and AI demand,” according to WestPark Capital.
Nvidia’s year-to-date rally has resulted in a lofty valuation. The stock trades at 44 times estimated earnings, above its 10-year average of 32, as well as at 21 times estimated sales. The Nasdaq 100 Index trades under four times estimated sales.

Stocks Fail to Catch a Bid Before Nvidia’s Results: Markets Wrap
Goldman Is Cracking Down on Employees That Aren't in Office Five Days a Week
Lithium mining is dominated by small and mid-sized firms in Australia, the world’s No.1 producer of the critical electric vehicle battery ingredient. Previously unknown companies have soared in value after striking large deposits of lithium-bearing spodumene, mainly in Western Australia, while others have sputtered on uncertainty. The sector’s shares offer some of the most volatile returns on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Liontown Resources Ltd. has surged 105% to lead the Australian gauge in 2023 after spurning three takeover bids in five months from the world’s top lithium producer Albemarle Corp. Meanwhile, peer Lake Resources NL has plummeted more than 70% after flagging a six-year delay and cost blowouts at a project in Argentina. The nation’s benchmark is up 1.2%.
Lithium stocks are “the gambling end of town, they tend to attract hot money and retail” betting, said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management in Sydney. He owns shares in Pilbara Minerals Ltd., which transformed from a A$500 million ($321 million) junior miner three years ago to a A$15 billion giant producing 8% of the world’s lithium. The stock has risen 32% in 2023. He also owns Allkem Ltd., up 25%.
Gains Topping 1,100%
Demand for lithium has surged in recent years as carmakers, driven by climate policies, attempt to reinvent themselves as EV manufacturers. That’s put a spotlight on stocks such as lithium miners that are part of the supply chain.
Azure Minerals Ltd. is among Australia’s emerging lithium stars, notching a surge of more than 1,100% this year. Earlier this month, it rejected a takeover bid from Chilean lithium producer SQM and has shot past its offer price of A$2.31. Patriot Battery Metals Inc., which is developing a large lithium deposit in Canada, has jumped 81%.
In South Korea, there’s a similar frenzy for shares perceived as being tied to the metal. Hydro Lithium Inc. skyrocketed more than 1,500% in 2022 after the little-known civil engineering firm changed its name from Korea SE Corp. and created plans for EV battery-related businesses. Chemicals firm Kum Yang Co. has jumped more than 400% this year on its link with a Mongolian lithium mine.

Australia’s lithium shares have tended to soar when companies announce a discovery, often with little regard to its size, accessibility or grade, said Carrick Ryan, portfolio manager at Westbeck Capital Management, an early investor in Pilbara Minerals and Patriot Battery Metals.
“In a market like we’re in today where it’s red hot for lithium explorers, if the stock moves up a lot on a skinny discovery, you should be careful,” he said.
But investors are becoming more selective. When it comes to producers, traders want to see evidence that a deposit can be turned into a productive mine, Ryan said.
“While confidence in the future of lithium remains robust, a discerning filtering strategy is coming into play,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. “The challenges posed by lithium prices are prompting investors to seek shelter in well-established names with strong cash flows and outlooks.”
Spot prices of lithium carbonate — a refined form of the metal — have been on a wild ride. They climbed to a record in November as a global push toward an electrified transport fleet fired up consumption, before plunging this year as supply pressures eased.
Some are looking elsewhere to play the EV boom. Out of all metals key to the clean energy transition, copper offers the most potential amid a looming shortage, Westbeck Capital Management’s Ryan said.
“If you could get an excellent copper discovery in a good jurisdiction, that would be the ideal situation,” he added.

NVDA,2023-08-22 22:12:37,The fund was launched by Tuttle Capital Management in March.,"An ETF that tracks CNBC television host Jim Cramer’s stock picks is shuttering after bringing in $1.3 million in assets since its launch in March.
The Long Cramer Tracker ETF (LJIM), which has gained about 3.7% over its lifetime, will halt trading Sept. 11 and liquidate Sept. 21, according to a press release. Launched by Tuttle Capital Management, the fund buys stocks that the television personality and former hedge fund manager recommends on his Mad Money show.
CEO Matthew Tuttle launched the ETF along with the Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), which shorts Cramer’s picks and is going to remain open.
Tuttle said in an interview that he started both funds in March to prove a point about a perceived lack of accountability that Cramer and other stock picking pundits take for poor bets. Tuttle is personally invested in SJIM, which bets against Cramer, and he primarily created LJIM to “engage in a dialogue,” he said.
“To me, the intermediate and long-term play is to short Jim Cramer’s picks,” Tuttle said.
After Cramer and CNBC largely ignored the funds once they launched, he decided to shutter LJIM: “We decided it just doesn’t make sense to keep the long side open. I was trying to be nice. If they’re not interested in a dialogue, I’m not going to keep it open.”
Jim Cramer’s ‘Lucky’ Bets
While LJIM has outperformed SJIM this summer, Tuttle chalked it up to Cramer’s “lucky” bets on Nvidia and other high-flying tech stocks. While LJIM is up 3.6% over the past three months, SJIM is down 1.5% over the same period.
Neither fund has picked up significant inflows; LJIM has seen $1.3 million in inflows while SJIM gained $3.5 million.
Tuttle is also behind the AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK), which shorts Cathie Wood’s fund. He said he’s open to launching short bet funds against other popular pundits in the future.
“If there’s some hypocrisy for me to call out, and I can create investment products around it that I personally would like to trade, then I’ll do it,” Tuttle noted.

It's on course to be the largest IPO of 2023 – and may become one of the largest in tech stock history.
The firm is seeking to expand into the domain of AI, which has supercharged markets this year.
Arm, the chip designer owned by SoftBank, is going public on the Nasdaq in September in what's set to be the biggest initial public offering in the US since 2021.
The British company's IPO – which hopes to raise up to $10 billion according to some estimates – is set to be the largest US listing since electric carmaker Rivian fetched over $12 billion in October 2021.
And it could become one of the largest tech-based floats in history – following Alibaba's $25 billion 2014 listing and Meta's (then-Facebook) $16 billion debut in 2012.
Though the brand is not well-known by consumers, its technology is present in over 90% of all smartphones. ""We estimate that approximately 70 percent of the world's population uses Arm-based products,"" the company said in its prospectus, seen by the Financial Times.
But relisting on public markets – having been taken private by tech investor SoftBank in 2016 – puts Arm on track to take advantage of the AI boom in markets this year.
The UK-based semiconductor firm, which has a near-monopoly in designing chips for smartphones, is now seeking to expand into the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, which has supercharged markets this year.
Semiconductor giant Nvidia, which has emerged as one of the stock market's biggest winners in 2023 after riding the ChatGPT wave to a $1 trillion-plus valuation, has long sought to acquire a stake in Arm.
Though a merger between the two firms fell through in 2020, Nvidia remains in talks to become an anchor investor in the company as it hits the market early September.
A stake in Arm would likely complement Nvidia's competencies as the world's leading chipmaker. The Santa Clara-based firm's stock is the best performer on the S&P 500 index this year – its share price has rocketed almost 230% from one year ago.",Chip designer Arm looks to ride the AI boom with the biggest US IPO since 2021,469.67001,456.67999,471.16,8,2023,22

Goldman Is Cracking Down on Employees That Aren't in Office Five Days a Week
In the letter seen by Bloomberg, USW President Tom Conway said workers cannot rely on management to put their interests first. “That’s why the contract we negotiated with US Steel contains strong protections that apply in this very circumstance,” Conway wrote.
The union plays a pivotal part in any transaction that involves the sale of US Steel mills or assets where the steelworkers are employed, and has been vocal about its exclusive support of Cliffs bid to buy the company.
The contract gives the union an opportunity to purchase US Steel assets in the event it receives any “bona fide offer” from a buyer. Conway last week advised US Steel and Cliffs that the union would transfer its legal right to launch a counteroffer for US Steel to Cliffs.

Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves in 2019 and 2020 acquired AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA assets, all of which had a heavy USW workforce presence. Goncalves famously kept all those jobs, promising not to close steel mills. It was a stark contrast from competitor US Steel which idled various assets over the years that resulted in union job cuts.
Conway in his letter pointed to US Steel canceling a $1.2 billion investment in the Mon Valley facility just outside Pittsburgh, and the company’s continuing effort to sell its blast furnace at Granite City to outsource production of pig iron instead of rebuilding the furnace for its own operations.
US Steel representatives were not immediately available for comment.

Goldman Is Cracking Down on Employees That Aren't in Office Five Days a Week
Stock traders are awaiting Nvidia Corp.’s results later Wednesday, which are set to test the fervor around the artificial-intelligence hype, while wider markets are marking time ahead of a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.
Contracts for Japanese shares dropped 0.6%, those for Hong Kong slipped 0.5% and futures for Australia’s benchmark eased 0.2%. Elevated bond yields continue to cause concern, even as moves moderated on Tuesday.
The 10-year Treasury rates were little changed after benchmark yields hit an almost 16-year high Monday as the resilient economy has investors positioning for the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs elevated.
The S&P 500 extended its August slide, with banks dropping as S&P Global Ratings joined Moody’s Investors Service in cutting some US lenders amid a “tough” climate. Macy’s Inc. sank 14% as credit-card delinquencies accelerated, raising a red flag about consumer health. Nvidia fell 2.8% on the eve of its quarterly report.
In a sign of how significant Nvidia’s results will be, the options market is bracing for a move of about 10% following the results. With Nvidia accounting for over 3% of the S&P 500, the stock action will possibly have broader implications. The shares briefly touched an all-time high on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the surge in US yields has been the primary reason stocks have declined over the past several weeks, with investors “pushing out” the date of expected rate cuts as they begin to accept the Fed may keep rates “higher for longer,” according to Tom Essaye, founder of “The Sevens Report” newsletter.
“It’s not the height of rates that matters as much as how long they stay high,” Essaye noted. “If we see Powell hint at higher for longer on Friday, we will need to brace for more equity market volatility.”
Powell is set to speak Friday at the Kansas City Fed’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Investors will look to the highly anticipated speech for clues on the outlook for interest rates, which the Fed last month lifted to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in 22 years.
Elsewhere in markets, major currencies traded in narrow ranges early Wednesday. The yen was steady after the third gain in four days, while remaining at a relatively weak level.
Key events this week:
Eurozone S&P Global Services & Manufacturing PMI, consumer confidence, Wednesday
UK S&P Global / CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI, Wednesday
US new home sales, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, Wednesday
US initial jobless claims, durable goods, Thursday

NVDA,2023-08-22 23:12:30,"""The estimated AI-driven earnings boost is likely to occur over the next few years, but should be reflected in stock valuations sooner,"" Goldman said.","The first AI trade has already unfolded in the stock market as investors bid up the ""enablers"" like Nvidia.
But there's a second, long-term AI trade to be had in the stock market, according to Goldman Sachs.
The ""AI trade after the trade"" is focused on companies that should see a massive labor productivity boost from AI.
There are two trades to be had in the stock market related to the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, and investors better pay attention, according to a Monday note from Goldman Sachs.
The promise of AI has taken over the stock market in 2023, helping save it from a painful bear market and catapulting one company to a more than $1 trillion market valuation: Nvidia.
Nvidia is an AI ""enabler"" and is among the first leg of the AI stock market trade, in which investors bid up companies that are poised to immediately benefit from the technology.
Other stocks that will see big near-term gains from AI include ""hyperscalers"" like cloud computing giants Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, as well as ""empowered users"" like Meta Platforms, Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, and Intuit.
But whereas enablers, hyperscalers, and empowered users represent the early AI trade to hit the stock market, there's a second, long-term AI trade that investors can still take advantage of, according to the note.
The bank put together a basket of ""AI trade after the trade"" stocks that are poised see surging corporate profits from labor productivity gains that are unlocked by the adoption of artificial intelligence technologies.
""The estimated AI-driven earnings boost is likely to occur over the next few years, but should be reflected in stock valuations sooner,"" Goldman Sachs said. ""The broader, longer-term benefit from AI adoption will accrue to companies as they harness AI to improve productivity, leading to greater revenues, higher margins, or a combination of both.""
Between 2025 and 2030, Goldman expects AI technologies to take hold within companies and have a noticeable impact on the macroeconomy as adoption picks up.
The bank estimates that the median Russell 1000 stock could see earnings rise 19% on efficiency gains from AI, while about 8% of Russell 1000 firms will see earnings rise more than 60%.
Here are the top 10 companies in Goldman Sachs' second AI trade basket.

Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd.-backed Alinta plans to raise A$675 million of new equity to fund the deal through an institutional placement, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The remainder of the agreement is funded by $993 million of new debt and a $75 million purchase plan for eligible shareholders, the company said.
The deal puts into new hands some of the biggest energy-generation assets powering industry in the vast and remote Pilbara region of Western Australia, an area synonymous with mines ranging from iron ore to lithium.
The expansion by APA is a big move at a moment of flux for energy providers. The deal adds a portfolio heavy with electricity infrastructure as pressure to shift Australia’s energy networks away from fossil fuels mounts — and even as many mining corporations that are turning electric have chosen to invest in their own on-site generation and storage.
Chow Tai Fook, backed by Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng, began exploring options for the Australian enterprise more than a year ago.

Raine and Arm share one all-important connection; both are backed by SoftBank Group Corp.
Financial advisers on IPOs like Raine don’t serve as underwriters and don’t buy or sell stock. They are sometimes brought in to assist companies in helping organize a big listing involving lots of banks.
Arm disclosed in its filing Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that in exchange for Raine’s advisory services for the IPO, the bank could receive compensation similar to how underwriters are paid.
Raine racked up $2.5 million for its services for the year ended March 31, according to the filing. Arm said the work already done by Raine entitles it to 5% of the underwriting discounts and commissions in what is expected to be the year’s biggest IPO—and the bank could earn an additional 5% of those discounts and commissions.
SoftBank and Raine have a lot of ties. Raine’s co-founder, Jeff Sine, has been a board member at Arm since 2022, according to Arm’s filing. SoftBank is also an investor in some of Raine’s funds, the prospectus shows.
Sine has known SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son since the 1990s and has worked on major deals involving its portfolio companies such as Sprint Corp.’s merger with T-Mobile US Inc., WeWork’s restructuring and Flipkart’s sale of a majority stake to Walmart Inc.
Raine was also one of Arm’s advisers in its deal to be acquired by Nvidia Corp. That transaction fell apart after regulatory and customer pushback.

Parliament’s endorsement of Srettha Thavisin will boost confidence that the coalition government headed by his Pheu Thai party can get on with implementing measures to spur economic growth, according to SCB Asset Management Co. Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy delivered slower-than-expected expansion during the second-quarter.
The benchmark SET Index has slumped 7.4% this year, with expectations of a rally after the nation’s May 14 election dashed as parliament blocked the appointment of a premier from the party that won most votes. Foreign investors have withdrawn almost $4 billion this year from Thailand’s equities as confidence was eroded by the political stalemate, slowing exports and higher interest rates.
READ: Thaksin Ally Elected New Thai PM, Ending Three-Month Impasse
“Most foreign funds should be more optimistic about Thailand’s economic outlook after the resolution of the prolonged political deadlock,” said Varorith Chirachon, an executive director at SCB Asset, which manages about $51 billion. “Srettha’s Pheu Thai party has a clear plan for new stimulus that should significantly help the economy at this critical time.”
Srettha, a former property tycoon, is Thailand’s first new leader since 2014, when former army chief Prayuth Chan-Ocha staged a coup. After forging a coalition that includes military aligned parties, Srettha won a majority of votes in a joint sitting of the parliament’s two chambers on Tuesday. Srettha, 61, can form a cabinet once his appointment is officially endorsed by the head of state, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Stocks and the baht rallied on Tuesday before the parliamentary vote was completed in anticipation of Srettha’s success. The SET Index jumped 1.3%, the most since July 14, as foreign investors bought a net $15 million. The baht climbed 0.5% against the dollar to its highest level in two weeks.
Still, deterioration in China’s growth outlook will continue to pressure the baht, according to RBC Capital Markets, noting that this year’s target for Chinese tourists won’t be met.
The Pheu Thai-led coalition has pledged to push through with promised policies including a 10,000 baht ($286) digital wallet for all Thais, a 600 baht minimum daily wage, a base salary of 25,000 baht for university graduates and higher crop prices.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares held tight ranges on Wednesday as investors awaited results from tech darling Nvidia to see if the sector's lofty valuations can withstand a jump in bond yields, while still gloomy factory readings from Japan left sentiment fragile.
S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3% while Nasdaq futures rose 0.4%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were up 0.1%, hovering not far away from its nine-month trough hit just two sessions ago. Japan's Nikkei rose a meagre 0.2%.
Data on Wednesday showed Japan's factory activity shrank for a third straight month in August, offering the first glimpse into the health of global manufacturing this month. The United States will also report its flash PMI readings on Wednesday, which is likely to show the factory sector remained in contraction.
Chinese shares gave up some gains, with blue-chips off 0.7% following a rebound of 0.8% the previous day, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index easing 0.1% after jumping 1%.
Metal prices kept climbing for a second day, with iron ore prices gaining as much as 3.2% and coking coal futures up by a similar amount.
Investors are eagerly awaiting results from chip company Nvidia due late on Wednesday. Its blockbuster report last quarter fueled a rally in tech stocks and artificial intelligence hopes, propelling the S&P 500 this year.
Shares of Nvidia hit an all-time high of $481.87 overnight, with options data showing traders are expecting a larger-than-usual swing in shares after the quarterly results.
Analysts expect Nvidia to forecast 110% growth in third-quarter revenue to $12.50 billion. Stuart Humphrey, an analyst at JPMorgan, said some are forecasting $14-15 billion.
""This kind of number feels a touch high to me, but if it sniffs this - one could argue that into this print, it doesn't matter if demand will eventually decline next year - (it) still will be rerated higher,"" Humphrey said.
Overnight, Wall Street was hit by higher yields which hit fresh 16-year highs. The Dow Jones fell 0.5%, the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1%.
Financial shares underperformed, with the S&P 500 banks sliding 2.4%, after S&P joined Moody's to downgrade multiple regional U.S. lenders.
Elsewhere, Treasuries took a breather from the recent rout. Ten-year yields eased 2 basis points to 4.3082% in Asia, after touching a 16-year top of 4.3660% a session earlier.
A jump in Treasury issuance, Fitch's credit downgrade three weeks ago and concerns China will dump Treasuries to support the yuan have added to a sell-off as investors await the Fed's annual summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week for more rate clues.
Comments from Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin raised expectations that Chair Jerome Powell would drive home a hawkish message, after strong U.S. economic data makes the ""reacceleration scenario"" possible.
In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar was still standing strong near its two month top at 103.5 against a basket of major currencies.
The yen gained 0.2% to 145.6 per dollar, pulling further away from a nine-month trough of 146.56, amid talks that Japan will only intervene in the market if the currency plunges past 150 to the dollar.
Oil prices were largely flat. Brent crude futures was little changed at $84.00 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also flat at $79.7.
The gold price was slightly higher at $1,901.2 per ounce.

Nvidia options imply a nearly 11% swing for the shares, in either direction, by Friday, according to Trade Alert data.

Half a Million US Jobs at Risk of Vanishing in Payroll Revision
Woodside Energy Group Ltd. and officials representing workers at its North West Shelf LNG facility have started discussions in Perth to negotiate pay and conditions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Talks are expected to continue until the evening.
The Offshore Alliance, a group representing two major labor unions, previously said that it will move forward with strikes as early as Sept. 2 if a deal isn’t reached on Wednesday.
The risk of disruptions to LNG exports from Australia, one of the world’s biggest suppliers, has sent Asian and European prices surging this month. Strikes at Woodside and Chevron Corp. facilities, which is facing similar labor action, may put as much as 10% of global LNG supply at risk just as the Northern Hemisphere prepares for winter.
Ballots opened over the last week on potential walkouts by workers at some of Chevron’s LNG facilities and will likely be finished by early next week.

Asian LNG buyers are holding back purchases and requesting looser delivery terms to avoid any potential impact. It’s unclear how long it will take for any strike action to materially affect exports.
“We are making good progress” in discussions, Woodside Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill said on Tuesday, noting that an agreement would have to cover the totality of the employment arrangement, and it isn’t as simple as just negotiating pay.
The pay disputes come as Woodside, Australia’s biggest oil and gas producer, said on Tuesday that first-half profits rose as record output from an expanded portfolio offset a downturn in prices.

Some of the top holdings in the Long Cramer ETF include Nvidia, Wells Fargo, Oracle, JPMorgan, and Monday.com. Some of the top holdings in the Inverse Cramer ETF include Tesla, PayPal, and Carvana.
""We started LJIM in order to facilitate a conversation with Jim Cramer around his stock picks as the other side to the Short Cramer ETF,"" Tuttle said in a press release. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Cramer and CNBC have been unwilling to engage in dialogue and instead have chosen to ignore the funds, therefore there is no reason to keep the long side going.""
In an e-mail to Insider, Tuttle said another reason for the formation of the Short Cramer ETF was ""to call out the hypocrisy of bringing Cramer out every day with his picks with no accountability.""
For the Long Cramer ETF, Tuttle told Insider: ""I decided to do LJIM in an effort to have a civil dialogue vs only having the short side and coming off as attacking him. I didn't talk to anyone at CNBC or have any pre conceived notions, just figured with Cramer's ego it would be game on.""
Tuttle said he will shift his focus away from the Long Cramer ETF and towards the Inverse Cramer ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol ""SJIM.""
The Inverse Cramer ETF has been more popular with investors, attracting just over $6 million in assets at its peak, though it currently has $3.4 million under management. The ETF still has a very long way to go in terms of attracting assets to be considered even a minor success in the industry.
Since both funds launched, the Long Cramer ETF has delivered the better performance, rising 0.3% since inception and at one point being up as much as 12.7% before this month's sell-off.
Meanwhile, the Inverse Cramer ETF is down 3.1% since its inception and was down as much as 13.3% before this month's sell-off.",An ETF that tracks Jim Cramer's stock picks is shutting down after failing to attract interest from investors,456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

Nvidia fell after reaching an intra-day high of $481.87. Investors await its earnings report on Wednesday.
Friday's Jackson Hole central bank summit is further factoring into market sentiment this week.
Stocks closed mixed Tuesday as investors prepare for Nvidia's earnings report this week and look beyond to the Federal Reserve's Jack Hole symposium.
The trillion-dollar chipmaker is set to release its financials on Wednesday, with observers betting that its results could reignite the AI rally of prior months.
In anticipation of this, the stock hit an intraday-high of $481.87, but has since climbed down. Of the S&P's top 10 equities, Nvidia is the only stock whose call options are eclipsing its put options, Bloomberg noted.
Outside of the tech sector, analysts seem divided on the potential for further rally, with some market bears warning of a stock slump and recession.
Adding to potential market upside this week is the coming Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, a central bank gathering where investors are betting dovish signals from the Federal Reserve.
That's as an earlier jump took the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest since 2007, though it has edged downward throughout the day on Tuesday. The surge brought interest rates back into the spotlight, giving central bank authorities some reason to tone down future monetary tightening, some Wall Street observers say.
But this is contrasted by pessimism around inflation, still ahead of the Fed's 2% target.

Back in the world of bonds, the 10-year Treasury yield continued its retreat from yesterday's peak of 4.366% in Asia time, slipping below 4.3%. It's a welcome respite from the steep bond selloff that had pushed yields up as much as 57 basis points in a month.

Core inflation, tracked by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to determine policy settings, slowed for a third straight month to a year-on-year rate of 3.8% in July, official data showed Wednesday. The measure, which excludes housing and private transportation costs, matched the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.
The data is a welcome piece of news for Singapore’s administration, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday pledging to help citizens cope with retirement and homeownership. The city-state’s monetary authority, which has tightened policy five times since 2021, is expected to stand pat again when it reviews settings next in October to support the economy, whose growth missed estimates last quarter.
All-items inflation cooled to 4.1% in July. That’s slower than the 4.2% forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey and the 4.5% reading in June.
“Global supply chain frictions have largely eased, and energy and food commodity prices remain below year-ago levels,” according to a joint statement from the MAS and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. “Inflation in Singapore’s major trading partners has also been on an easing trend,” the authorities said, noting that the core measure will likely moderate further over the next few months.
For 2023, headline and core inflation are projected to average 4.5%–5.5% and 3.5%–4.5%, respectively, the authorities said in the statement, reiterating a projection shared last month.

The Brook Global Emerging Markets Fund — run by Sophia Whitbread, the only female portfolio manager at what used to be Crispin Odey’s investment empire — will close no later than Sept. 22 “due to the significant reduction in assets under management,” the firm said Tuesday in a letter to clients.
The fund’s assets had dropped to $33 million at the end of July, from a peak of $104 million earlier this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A spokesperson for the London-based firm declined to comment.

Whitbread, who previously worked at Newton Investment Management, joined Brook two years ago and manages the emerging market strategy that fell 10.1% this year through Monday. She took over from Robert Marshall-Lee who left a year after joining Odey Asset Management.
Since June, the firm has shut two other funds while its money managers including Freddie Neave, Adrian Courtenay, James Hanbury and Oliver Kelton are being rehoused at external investment firms.

The chipmaker has added more than $370 billion in market value since its last update, and is the biggest contributor to the Nasdaq 100’s 36% rally this year. Nvidia’s processors are the picks and shovels in the AI gold-rush that has fueled markets this year, making its report much more significant than a typical earnings release.
“What Nvidia says about guidance for the remainder of FY24 drives the sentiment around the entire AI thesis that has driven the market,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Melius Research.
The chipmaker’s Wall Street cheerleaders are expecting more good news.
Analysts have been raising price targets ahead of the second-quarter report, which is expected to show revenue up 65% from the same period a year ago to about $11 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. According to Citigroup, expectations from institutional investors are even higher, at around $12 billion.
And many analysts, like HSBC’s Frank Lee, say the stock has further to run — despite more than tripling this year to trade at a whopping 44 times projected profits.
“Although market expectations have clearly risen for Nvidia and the overall AI supply chain, we expect bullish AI server momentum continued to surpass market expectations,” Lee wrote in a research note on Monday, arguing that the long-term earnings potential still isn’t reflected by Nvidia’s stock price.
As one of just a handful of companies worth more than $1 trillion, Nvidia’s share-price move after earnings has the potential to take the entire S&P 500 with it. Options market activity is implying a 10% swing in the stock price on the day after the report, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Inevitably, other stocks exposed to AI — heavyweights like Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. and smaller companies like Palantir Technologies Inc. — will see the biggest impact. But the report is important for markets outside the US — for stocks like Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and chip equipment giant ASML Holding NV.
With expectations so high, a disappointment would hit hard.
“If they miss, the entire stock market’s gonna go down,” Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, said in an interview. “There’s no question about that.”
One wildcard is supply. Some on Wall Street are warning that sales might be limited by Nvidia’s ability to secure enough chips from TSMC. Still, most don’t see it being a problem for the stock if forecasts are good, because those sales would be pushed into subsequent quarters.
For the broader market, facing headwinds including higher interest rates and an economic slowdown, a positive report may help to reassure that AI has game-changing potential to boost productivity and profits in many industries. Strategists at Goldman Sachs this week introduced an “AI trade after the trade” basket — stocks with the largest potential long-term earnings boost from the impact of AI on labor productivity.
Earnings for the median stock in that basket could be 72% higher than the current baseline following widespread AI adoption, strategists led by Ryan Hammond wrote in a note.
But Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson — a stalwart equity bear — cautioned that souring sentiment about the macroeconomic backdrop means that even blowout results may not be enough to propel markets higher this time.
“We don’t think outstanding results from Nvidia will change the complexion of the more recent price action for the other derivative plays or for the broader market in the way it did in May,” he wrote.

Economic data releases and earnings
Investors are salivating in anticipation of Nvidia’s earnings today after the close of trading, with analysts rushing to boost their estimates.
The big question, of course, is whether Nvidia can live up to AI hype. But perhaps the bigger question for investors is what other companies are already benefiting and monetizing demand for artificial intelligence.
The answer right now seems to be none — or at least none near the scale at which Nvidia is already profiting. But there are firms, both chipmakers and those in the larger AI ecosystem, that are starting to see revenue come in related to AI, with the promise (they say) of much more.
One of the lesser-known names making an AI pitch is Synopsys (SNPS). Chipmakers use the company’s software to design and verify their products. Synopsys’ incoming CEO Sassine Ghazi told Yahoo Finance Live that AI currently accounts for about 10% of sales, and is only in its early stages.
According to Ghazi, there are two factors shaping chip demand: the trend toward ""everything is smart"" (fridge, car, watch), and AI.
""With AI, in order to make it happen and a reality, you need more sophisticated chips in the cloud or in the datacenter as well as more sophisticated chips on the edge. With those two factors, the demand for semiconductors is unprecedented,"" said Ghazi, who is set to succeed founder Aart de Geus as CEO on Jan. 1.
Synopsys last week reported third-quarter revenue rose by 19% to $1.49 billion, and forecast fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. Earlier in the week, it announced a new contract with Intel to develop intellectual property for the company’s new factories, which will increasingly involve AI.
“When you look at the engineers available to develop and design these chips, they are at an all-time shortage,” Ghazi said. “This is where Synopsys plays a huge role in the automation and modernization of the chip design. You can implement AI for chip design where you can reduce the tasks from many engineers to fewer engineers in a much shorter time.”
All of that said, most of the current demand for chips is still being driven by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), smartphones and other processes that don’t involve generative AI.
Like Synopsys, Applied Materials (AMAT) sees most of the demand for AI in its future. The largest manufacturer of chipmaking equipment last week reported earnings, saying equipment for AI now accounts for 5% of its total sales, compared with 20% for datacenter and 10% to 15% for IoT. AMAT Chief Financial Officer Brice Hill said peers have discussed a growth rate of 30% to 50% for AI demand. “So if you view 5% as a relatively small amount, we do think that it's growing rapidly and will be an important workload going forward,” he said on the call.
Of course, some investors want AI to be monetized now and aren’t willing to wait. Matthew Bryson, who covers the semiconductor industry as senior vice president of hardware equity research at Wedbush, says Nvidia is the way to go.
“I think it’s easiest to buy Nvidia and forget it,” he said. And he said it’s less important what Nvidia reports in terms of exact numbers and more important what it discusses around AI demand.
“There is a ton of demand out there right now,” Bryson said. “It’s not being satisfied. It takes 40-plus weeks to get it from Nvidia. There’s just not enough supply.”

While signs of an alarming second month in a row of euro zone business contraction from early flash readings of monthly surveys is hardly good news, it has served to take more heat out of restive bond markets by flagging a cooling of global demand. Equivalent U.S. surveys are due later.

With an awkward U.S. 20-year bond auction due on Wednesday, the downbeat news from the euro zone - and a big miss in British surveys too - helped drag long-term U.S. bond yields back lower in early trade.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields recoiled to 4.25%, more than 10 basis point off the 16-year high hit early on Tuesday, the 30-year year yield is down more than 12bp from 12-year highs hit this week and even two-year yields slipped back below 5%.
The dollar hit its highest since early June as both the euro and sterling took a hit.
With the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole conference kicking off on Thursday, the latest U.S. economic numbers suggest the central bank need not be too alarmed by a re-acceleration of the economy.
Existing home sales dropped to a six-month low in July, with new home sales numbers due later today. The Philadelphia Fed's August service sector survey also showed a steep drop in activity.
Benchmark revisions to U.S. payrolls estimates for the year through March 2023 are also due out later on Wednesday and many expect they will reveal that the labour market is not quite as tight as had been assumed.
With that all being digested - and aided by the retreat in bond yields - stock investors hope Wednesday's post-bell earnings report from Nvidia can rejuvenate the artificial intelligence craze that saw tech stocks surge earlier this year.
Nvidia shares have tripled in 2023 and the chip giant's year-to-date increase has led gains among the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' group of megacaps, including Apple and Microsoft. That group's collective rise was responsible for roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500’s increase through July.
The tech focus will have to offset another slide in bank stocks, many of which were hit on Tuesday after a series of credit rate downgrades.
An early rally on Wall St fizzled by the close on Tuesday, but futures were back higher again today ahead of the open.
European and Japanese shares were up smartly too, but mainland Chinese stocks underperformed yet again and dropped another 1%-plus. Chinese stocks are now down almost 10% for the year to date.
Events to watch for on Wednesday:
* Flash August business surveys from United States and around the world, U.S. July new home sales, U.S. benchmark payroll revisions for 2023
* U.S. corporate earnings: Nvidia, Analog Devices, NetApp, Autodesk, Advance Auto Parts, Bath & Body Works
* BRICS Summit in Johannesburg
* U.S. Treasury auctions 20-year bond, 2-yr floating rate notes

NVDA,2023-08-23 11:14:10,The chip giant's GPUs have become hot property in tech as AI companies drive demand to build the large language models behind buzzy apps like ChatGPT.,"Nvidia is preparing to at least triple production of its GPUs driving the AI boom.
The chip giant was seeking to ship at least 1.5 million H100 processors next year, The FT reported.
Demand for these GPUs has soared given their role in building huge AI models behind applications such as ChatGPT.
Nvidia is preparing to triple the production of a $40,000 processor powering the generative AI revolution as the threat of shortages weighs on the ambitions of companies seeking to capitalize on the AI boom, a fresh report says.
The Silicon Valley chip giant wants to boost production of its hotly pursued H100 processor, named after computer scientist Grace Hopper, with the aim of shipping between 1.5 million and 2 million units next year, up from the 500,000 target this year, the Financial Times reported.
Nvidia soared to a $1 trillion market capitalization in May, with AI companies driving huge demand for its processors also known as GPUs – a fundamental component in the development of large language models underlying buzzy AI tools such as ChatGPT.
The importance of processors to the AI boom has led to a global scramble as companies and nation states have raced to secure a strong supply. Earlier this month, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had bought up thousands of Nvidia's H100 units.
Meanwhile, rich VCs with the capital to buy GPUs have been busy purchasing them for portfolio startups seeking to build their own AI models trained on the data they sit on.
Nvidia's AI processors have proven so popular that Chinese firms have been willing to buy them through underground markets in Hong Kong, Reuters reported in June, as US export rules bar Nvidia from selling its top-end processors to China.
Nvidia is preparing to report second-quarter earnings for its fiscal year after markets close on Wednesday, with AI companies and investors set to watch closely to hear CEO Jensen Huang's outlook for products vital to the AI boom.
In Nvidia's first quarter, where it announced a massive 19% jump in revenue to $7.2 billion from the previous quarter, Huang said the company was ""significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand"" for products like the H100.
Nvidia did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment outside regular working hours.","Nvidia plans to triple production of its $40,000 chips as it races to meet huge demand from AI companies, report says",456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

(Reuters) -U.S. stock index futures inched higher on Wednesday, with the spotlight firmly on Nvidia quarterly results due later in the day that could potentially reignite an artificial intelligence-fuelled rally in megacap growth stocks this year.
A blowout forecast from chip designer Nvidia last quarter helped the stock more than triple in value this year and powered large gains in other megacap shares in the 'Magnificent Seven' group, propelling the S&P 500 14% higher.
Rising bets that Nvidia's revenue target will once again surpass Wall Street estimates pushed the chipmaker's stock to a record high on Tuesday, but analysts also fear that a failure to match investor expectations could trigger a wider selloff in stock markets.
""Nvidia's valuation depends on confidence in the AI revolution and demand for its hi-tech chips and while it's expected that this won't have waned substantially, its stratospheric rise this year could make the stock vulnerable to any small set back,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
""If the voracious demand for artificial intelligence technology shows little sign of abating, there is likely to be renewed enthusiasm for tech companies with their fingers in all sorts of AI pies.""
Traders in the U.S. equity options market are bracing for a larger-than-usual swing in Nvidia shares following the chipmaker's earnings, which are due after markets close on Wednesday.
Nvidia shares were up 0.4% in premarket trading, while shares of other major technology and growth companies were mixed, with Tesla down 2.5% after a report said the company lowered the production target of its German plant.
Megacap growth stocks had stumbled in the first few weeks of August after signs of a still strong U.S. economy spurred worries that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates elevated for longer, sending government bond yields surging.
Supporting equities on Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped from near 16-year highs hit in the previous session amid lingering concerns over higher-for-longer rates.
S&P Global's flash U.S. Composite PMI index for August, due at 9:45 am ET, could provide additional clues on the strength of business activity and the path for interest rates ahead of a keenly awaited speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.
Traders' bet the Fed would keep rates unchanged in September stands at 86.5%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, though they have scaled back expectations of rate cuts from the central bank.
At 7:15 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 34 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 4.25 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.75 points, or 0.03%.
Shares of drugmakers Arcus Biosciences and Merck & Co advanced 28.7% and 1.3%, respectively, after Swiss rival Roche inadvertently published positive lung cancer drug trial data from an interim analysis.
Sport retailers Nike and Under Armour fell 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively, after a downbeat profit forecast from Foot Locker, whose shares slumped 28.4%.
Peloton Interactive shares plunged 27% after the fitness equipment maker forecast first-quarter revenue below estimates.

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry, then check out 5 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.
Technology is one of the most glamorous and lucrative industries these days. The soaring popularity of technology firms and stocks follows the massive impact that personal computing, connectivity, and the Internet have made on our lives. In fact, nearly every aspect of modern day living, whether it's work, transportation, entertainment, shopping, or business, has been revolutionized by technology and the firms that play a role in this have seen their shares rewarded heftily on the stock market.
When we look at mega cap stocks, out of the ten largest companies traded on U.S. exchanges in terms of market capitalization, eight are technology stocks. This makes the segment one of the most lucrative in the world, and it is also a segment that has defied investor expectations and soared to new highs in 2023. The broader economic environment this year has been worrying, to say the least, with the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes jolting the stock market last year. These hikes were expected to continue this year, but very few investors could have predicted in 2022 that the first half of 2023 would see big tech retake most of 2022's losses with the tech heavy NASDAQ 100 index gaining 45% between January to June.
Leading the charge in the mega cap arena is the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares have gained more than 300% on the stock market this year, fueled by the firm's stunning guidance for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2023. While Wall Street analysts were expecting the firm to guide the Q2 revenue at $7.2 billion, NVIDIA blew past these estimates as it projected its first annual revenue growth in the last couple of quarters by expecting the net sales figure to sit at $11 billion. Analysts were delighted, to say the least, and they have rated NVIDIA's shares as Strong Buy on average. As if this weren't enough, the firm's average share price target is $524.19, and based on the closing share price at the time of writing, this pens in an upside of 14.8%. Briefly looking at recent analyst coverage, out of the ten analyst notes that have covered the shares, eight have rated them as either Strong Buy, Overweight, or Outperform.
The surge in NVIDIA's shares is part of the broader hype in the industry surrounding artificial intelligence. AI is a set of technologies that leverage high powered computing systems to use pre determined relationships to generate insights into new data. The uptick of AI by firms has been equally explosive, with data from McKinsey showing that in less than a year after the debut of the latest technologies, nearly 25% of top level executives said that they are using AI technologies while 40% have already set AI as an agenda on their board. Bifurcating the responses according to industries, the top two industrial users of AI are the technology & telecommunications and financial services industries. In terms of business roles, marketing and product development professionals are the highest users of AI while manufacturing and supply chain people rely the least on the latest technology. One additional industry that heavily benefits from AI and has been using it even before the recent mania is the biotechnology sector, and for more details on this particular front, be sure to check out 11 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today.
Shifting gears from technology to financial evaluation, one way in which stocks are valued is the price to earnings ratio. This ratio comes in several flavors, out of which the most popular is the price to trailing earnings ratio. If you want to find out what this ratio is all about, we've covered it in detail in 10 Best Inexpensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. As a short primer for the sake of this piece, this ratio divides a firm's current share price with its earnings per share in its four latest quarters, providing a moving valuation that incorporates the latest financial results to gauge market sentiment about a stock. A P/E ratio below an industry average implies that a stock is undervalued and its share price can potentially appreciate in the future. A ratio that is higher than the average can indicate, purely from a P/E ratio perspective, that the price might come down in the future. We've sifted dozens of stocks through their P/E ratios, in pieces such as 10 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To Invest In and 12 Undervalued European Stocks to Buy.
Today, we'll take a look at undervalued technology stocks being bought by hedge funds, out of which the top picks are Avnet, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVT), Gen Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:GEN), and Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC).

Foot Locker (FL): Shares in the sportswear company plummeted 30% on Wednesday during premarket trading. The retailer told investors it would suspend its quarterly dividend payments following weaker-than-expected second quarter sales and a lower full-year profit outlook.
Peloton (PTON): The connected fitness company saw shares fall more than 25% after reporting fourth quarter results that disappointed with subscriber churn rising and costs from a seat post recall coming in higher than the company had expected.
AMC (AMC): Shares in the entertainment company continued to fall on Wednesday, losing as much as 20% in pre-market trading ahead of a share conversion that will see its common and preferred stock merged into a single share class.
Stock futures muted ahead of Nvidia
It's the earnings report that investors won't stop focusing on.
Nvidia will report results after the close on Wednesday, and investors are anxious to see how the company pays this quarter off after forecasting revenue for the quarter that was 50% higher than Wall Street estimates back in May.
The company's central role in the AI hype cycle — which many strategists saw as key to the market's rally in the spring — also has some commentators looking to the stock to kickstart equity markets after a sluggish start to the month.
Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a client note earlier this week, ""While momentum has certainly slowed a bit in recent weeks, this hardly justifies sufficient technical weakness to avoid NVDA at a time when the stock (in the short run) peaked out right near its former all-time highs near $480.""
In Newton's view, the rally we've seen in NVDA this week suggests the stock's next technical barrier comes on the upside rather than the downside, with Newton looking for shares to approach $500 by mid-September.
""Until proper evidence is in place, technicals still appear bullish, and I feel like recent consolidation should be answered with an upside breakout of this recent range, not a downside breakout,"" Newton wrote. ""Thus, my view is that NVDA likely pushes up to $500 into mid-September, and this represents the first meaningful area of resistance to the stock’s rally in the near-term.""",Stock futures point to modest gains ahead of Nvidia earnings: Stock market news today,456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

Shares of the chipmaker reached an intraday record high above $481 on Tuesday before losing ground during the session, falling 2.7% on the day. On Monday, Nvidia stock rose more than 5%.
Wall Street analysts are expecting the chip giant to post second quarter adjusted earnings of $2.07 per share and revenue of $11.04 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
Analysts have been raising their price targets on Nvidia stock in a string of bullish calls over the past few weeks.
""We expect a significant beat"" for Nvidia's fiscal second quarter, Baird's Tristan Gerra and his team in a recent note to investors. The firm cited ""very significant momentum in AI demand for Nvidia"" and raised its price target on the stock to $570 from $475 while maintaining an Outperform rating.
""NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters,"" Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore and his team wrote in a recent client note.
Meanwhile, UBS analysts raised their price target to $540 from $475, writing that Nvidia ""is quite literally serving as 'kingmaker' as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.""
Nvidia stock has been on fire since the start of 2023, rising more than 210% year to date.
The chipmaker led the tech sector higher earlier in the year as it moved center stage amid an AI craze, thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products.
Information technology stocks have pulled back a bit in recent weeks amid concerns of an overbought market and rising bond yields; August is also historically a weak month for stocks.
In the first two weeks of August, Nvidia stock fell as much as 12% from recent highs.
""We think the recent selloff is a good entry point,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Moore.

Here’s what Wall Street expects of Nvidia in the quarter, as compiled by Bloomberg, versus how it performed in the same quarter last year.
Revenue: $11.04 billion expected versus $6.70 billion in Q2 last year.
Adjusted EPS: $2.07 expected versus $0.52 in Q2 last year.
Data center revenue: $7.98 billion expected versus $3.81 billion in Q2 last year.
Gaming revenue: $2.38 billion expected versus $2.04 billion in Q2 last year.
The AI craze kicked into high gear in Nov. 2022 when OpenAI debuted its generative AI app, ChatGPT. And while artificial intelligence has been around for some time, ChatGPT’s popularity, it was one of the fastest growing apps in history, put the technology firmly on Wall Street’s radar.
Since then tech companies ranging from giants ranging from Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) to smaller firms have debuted or announced that they’re working on their own generative AI tools and software.
Nvidia, which has been investing in its AI capabilities for years, is helping to power those products.
But Nvidia’s success could also prove problematic. The rapid increase in demand for its chips is putting pressure on supplier TSMC to produce as many graphics processors as possible. But the company might not be able to keep up, which could put a strain on Nvidia’s revenue.
Despite that, expectations for the chip giant continue to soar on Wall Street. Analysts anticipate Nvidia will bring in a whopping $12.51 billion in revenue for the upcoming quarter. That’s an enormous jump from the same time last year, when revenue came in at $5.93 billion.
Part of that reason for that difference is that Nvidia’s gaming revenue fell 51% year-over-year in Q3 2022. But even if that segment continues to rebound, as it is expected to this quarter, it would still mean an enormous leap in overall revenue.
If Nvidia misses expectations, though, it could mean a pullback in the overall AI hype cycle. That said, it certainly wouldn’t be a death knell for AI.

NVDA,2023-08-23 14:15:34,Nvidia stock was higher early Wednesday ahead of the company's highly-anticipated earnings report after the bell.,"Nvidia (NVDA) stock gained as much as 1.9% on Wednesday moring ahead of the company's highly anticipated quarterly earnings report due after the closing bell.
Shares of the chipmaker reached an intraday record high above $481 on Tuesday before losing ground during the session, falling 2.7% on the day. On Monday, Nvidia stock rose more than 5%.
Wall Street analysts are expecting the chip giant to post second quarter adjusted earnings of $2.07 per share and revenue of $11.04 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
Analysts have been raising their price targets on Nvidia stock in a string of bullish calls over the past few weeks.
""We expect a significant beat"" for Nvidia's fiscal second quarter, Baird's Tristan Gerra and his team in a recent note to investors. The firm cited ""very significant momentum in AI demand for Nvidia"" and raised its price target on the stock to $570 from $475 while maintaining an Outperform rating.
""NVIDIA remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters,"" Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore and his team wrote in a note to clients.
Meanwhile, UBS analysts raised their price target to $540 from $475, writing that Nvidia ""is quite literally serving as 'kingmaker' as a huge wave of capital and new financing vehicles are chasing new AI software and specialized cloud infrastructure models.""
Nvidia stock has been on fire since the start of 2023, rising more than 210% year to date.
The chipmaker led the tech sector higher earlier in the year as it moved center stage amid an AI craze, thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products.
Information technology stocks have pulled back a bit in recent weeks amid concerns of an overbought market and rising bond yields; August is also historically a weak month for stocks.
In the first two weeks of August, Nvidia stock fell as much as 12% from recent highs.
""We think the recent selloff is a good entry point,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Moore.

NVDA,2023-08-23 15:39:35,"The company hopes that investors look to its AI future, not its smartphone past","On August 21st Arm, a chipmaker whose designs power most of the world’s smartphones, filed for an initial public offering (ipo) that could turn out to be the largest of the year. The route taken by the British firm, which is owned by SoftBank Group, a Japanese technology conglomerate, has not been straightforward. In 2016 SoftBank acquired Arm, then listed on the London Stock Exchange, for $31bn. Four years later a proposed $40bn sale to Nvidia, another chipmaker, was squashed by competition authorities. Now a blockbuster listing is in prospect that would also signal a revival of an ipo market that has been largely dormant since 2022.
Arm will now be listed on America’s tech-heavy Nasdaq as soon as early September, ending a period of uncertainty for the company. SoftBank will retain majority control and pocket all the proceeds from the listing. The ipo filing does not specify how much Arm intends to raise or the chipmaker’s worth, though in August SoftBank paid $16bn for a 25% stake which was held by the group’s Vision Fund, a tech investment vehicle, putting Arm’s value at around $64bn. The speculation is that it will seek around $60bn-70bn, or around 21-25 times annual sales. That would place it closer to the lofty multiples of Nvidia, the leader of the artificial-intelligence gold rush, than the chasing pack (see chart).
The ubiquity of Arm’s chip designs may seem to justify a juicy valuation. Unlike its competitors, which design, manufacture and sell chips, Arm deals only in intellectual property. It makes money by licensing its designs, which customers can modify if required, and takes a small cut from every chip built. Using Arm’s off-the-shelf designs allows companies to build a processor at a fraction of the cost of designing it themselves. As a result, its chips are everywhere.
Its technology sits within 99% of the world’s smartphones. In devices from industrial sensors to smart toasters or anything else that now connects to the internet, its designs feature in 65% of their processors. In the automotive sector Arm has a 41% market share and even in the lucrative cloud-computing market, long dominated by Intel, Arm-based processors account for 10% of the chips sold.
The ai boom brightens Arm’s prospects. Earlier in August Nvidia unveiled Grace Hopper, a new chip that combines an Arm-based central processing unit (cpu) with its graphics-processing unit (gpu). The fully integrated chip promises to run bigger and faster versions of the language models that are trained on text from the internet to produce human-like output. And as Sara Russo of Bernstein, a broker, points out, as ai moves from data centres to consumer apps, devices capable of running ai functions using less energy will be needed. Arm, with its expertise in low-power, high-performance chip design, should be in a good position to meet the demand.
ai hype is one thing. But other tech trends look less encouraging. Begin with sluggish demand. The majority of Arm’s sales come from processors for smartphones, cars and other connected devices. Sales of these chips have lately been weaker than expected. In August Qualcomm, an American chipmaker that specialises in smartphone processors, reported a 23% drop in sales in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier. It expects the downturn to drag on until at least the end of the year. The forecast for automotive chips is similarly gloomy. Expanding demand from ai will not be enough to offset a drop-off in Arm’s core products.
Arm’s position as the only supplier of easy-to-use chip designs is also in question, from risc-v, an open-source alternative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. risc-v designs are available to anyone without a licence or fee. Alan Priestley of Gartner, a market-research firm, believes it is a “growing threat” to Arm. For now risc-v serves the lower end of the market—sensors, connected devices and automotive chips. But as the technology improves, the promise of licence- and royalty-free designs for expensive smartphone and data-centre processors could prove a problem for Arm. In the year to March 2023 all its revenues came from licensing ($1bn) and royalties ($1.6bn).
The company’s reliance on Arm China—a separate entity—for a quarter of its revenues is another cause for concern for investors. In its filings the company admits that it is “particularly susceptible” to tensions between China and America. In December Arm chose not to license its designs for a high-end cpu to Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant, for fear that it would fall foul of a ban imposed by America last year on selling certain cutting-edge chips in China.
The question is whether the hype around ai means that investors pay less attention to such worries. When the deal to sell Arm to Nvidia fell through in 2022, Son Masayoshi, the founder of SoftBank, vowed to take Arm public in the “the largest ipo in semiconductor history”. ai exuberance in a market starved of blockbuster ipos may make his wish come true.

QQQ Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Forecast: Markets Wrap
With the new tools, clients will be able to generate suggestions about marketing strategy and use internal data to build automated contact support services, the company announced Wednesday ahead of its annual user conference.
These new features will be integrated into Twilio’s customer data platform, which organizes consumer information for uses like marketing. A recent report from industry analyst IDC showed San Francisco-based Twilio with the highest market share for customer data platforms over runners-up Adobe Inc. and Publicis Groupe SA’s Epsilon. But the market is still unsettled — Twilio’s leading position amounted to only 10% of the market.
Twilio’s platform also will add new tools to help clients organize their data for a variety of AI uses, the company said. “Most companies actually don’t have their data ready in a format where it’s usable” with large language models, said Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson in an interview. Large language models are the technology powering AI tools that can generate text and images from a user’s prompts.
Twilio’s growth plan hinges on the success of its CDP business. The service the company is best known for — facilitating business-to-consumer messaging — faces increased competition. Like many software peers, Twilio has focused on boosting profits as revenue growth has slowed and the company has cut headcount more than 28% since September over two rounds of layoffs.

Twilio said it’s using large language models from companies including OpenAI and Google for the new features. Pricing hasn’t been determined, Lawson said, adding that the company’s main CDP platform, called Segment, currently charges based on how many individuals each customer is tracking.
Almost every major software company has unveiled new AI features, seeking to capitalize on demand spurred by interest in OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT. Twilio’s bet is that companies will need help preparing and accessing data to take advantage of the emerging technology.
“AI is only as good as the data that you have,” Lawson said.

Peloton shares touch record-low
Peloton (PTON) shares hit an all-time low on Wednesday as the company saw a slowdown in subscribers and absorbed a larger than expected loss on a recall for one its bikes.
""Growth also was slowed by the seat post recall we announced on May 11th in so far as first party and third party sales of our original Peloton Bike were supply constrained by seat post availability,"" the company said in a shareholder letter on Wednesday.
""The cost of this recall substantially exceeded our initial expectations leading to an additional accrual of $40 million this quarter for actual costs incurred as well as anticipated future recall-related expenses.""
Subscriptions declined by 29,000 from the prior quarter while the company's revenue forecast for the first quarter came in weaker than expected. Pelotons forecasted first quarter revenue of $580 million-$600 million, below consensus analyst expectations of $647.8 million.
""We still believe Peloton could be better served bear-hugging their loyalists as a smaller, healthier company."" BMO Capital Markets senior analyst Simeon Siegel wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Survey says — The US economy continues to lose momentum
The initial read on economic activity in August from S&P Global out Wednesday pointed to a further loss of momentum in the US economy.
The firm's services PMI reached a six-month low at 51.0 while its manufacturing PMI came in at 47.5, a two-month low. For these surveys, readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector while readings below 50 indicate contraction.
""A near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of US economic growth in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""The survey shows that the service sector-led acceleration of growth in the second quarter has faded, accompanied by a further fall in factory output.""
Williamson added the report shows companies see ""demand [that] is looking increasingly lethargic in the face of high prices and rising interest rates,"" though notes a softening in demand could help inflation pressures continue to ease somewhat.
In recent months, survey data like S&P and the ISM's PMI reports have suggested a softening in economic conditions more dramatic than what has been seen in the monthly jobs reports, retail sales data, and GDP reads. Other measures like the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker are in outright conflict with survey-level data.
How — or if — these tensions are resolved will be key to the US economic story as we head towards 2024.

Peloton (PTON): The connected fitness company saw shares fall more than 25% after reporting fourth quarter results that disappointed with subscriber churn rising and costs from a seat post recall coming in higher than the company had expected.
AMC (AMC): Shares in the entertainment company continued to fall on Wednesday, losing as much as 20% in premarket trading ahead of a share conversion that will see its common and preferred stock merged into a single share class.
Stock futures muted ahead of Nvidia
It's the earnings report that investors won't stop focusing on.
Nvidia will report results after the close on Wednesday, and investors are anxious to see how the company pays this quarter off after forecasting revenue for the quarter that was 50% higher than Wall Street estimates back in May.
The company's central role in the AI hype cycle — which many strategists saw as key to the market's rally in the spring — also has some commentators looking to the stock to kickstart equity markets after a sluggish start to the month.
Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a client note earlier this week, ""While momentum has certainly slowed a bit in recent weeks, this hardly justifies sufficient technical weakness to avoid NVDA at a time when the stock (in the short run) peaked out right near its former all-time highs near $480.""
In Newton's view, the rally we've seen in NVDA this week suggests the stock's next technical barrier comes on the upside rather than the downside, with Newton looking for shares to approach $500 by mid-September.
""Until proper evidence is in place, technicals still appear bullish, and I feel like recent consolidation should be answered with an upside breakout of this recent range, not a downside breakout,"" Newton wrote. ""Thus, my view is that NVDA likely pushes up to $500 into mid-September, and this represents the first meaningful area of resistance to the stock’s rally in the near-term.""","Tech stocks rally, yields drop, ahead of Nvidia earnings: Stock market news today",456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday as shares of Nvidia gained ahead of quarterly results from the company whose chips are widely used for artificial intelligence (AI) computing.
Investors expect that another strong outlook from Nvidia could fuel a further rally in tech stocks. It is due to report after the closing bell.
Shares of Nvidia rose ahead of the report, adding to recent gains. Its stock is up more than 220% for the year so far.
Adding to Wall Street's upbeat mood, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note eased from near 16-year highs after weak business activity data from the United States and the euro zone.
""What's troubled this market has been the persistent rise in rates at the longer end,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on Friday at the Jackson Hole conference will be scrutinized for clues on the U.S. central bank's interest rate path.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 48.84 points, or 1.11%, to end at 4,436.39 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 215.16 points, or 1.59%, to 13,721.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.50 points, or 0.55%, to 34,477.33.
Nvidia's report and comments will be key to the broad market, Meckler said.
""Not just their numbers, but what they say in the conference call about what's happening in AI is going to have a big impact on market sentiment,"" he said.
Nvidia is part of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks including Apple and Tesla that have powered the S&P 500's sharp gains this year, and investors fear a selloff if the company fails to meet expectations.
According to strategists in a Reuters poll, the S&P 500 will eke out only marginal gains between now and year end, after its strong move up already this year. The index was forecast to end the year at 4,496.

Here come Nvidia earnings...
Tech has rallied into the afternoon on Wednesday as markets brace for Nvida (NVDA) to report earnings after the bell. In May, the chipmaker said it expected artificial intelligence demand to push its current quarter sales forecast from ~$7 billion to ~$11 billion, sparking an AI-infused rally in stocks.
Given Nvidia's influence on overall markets this year, some strategists think tonight's report could be a major market mover. On Tuesday, Jim Bianco of Bianco Resarch wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Nvidia earnings are ""becoming a macro event similar to payrolls and CPI.""
Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel thinks Nvidia earnings could be the next market catalyst.
""Given that the public has begun to sell stocks in recent weeks into the challenging [seasonality], we would expect anything besides a decisive breakout [in NVDA stock] toward $500 as being neutral to negative for the broader market, keeping uncertainty 'bid,'"" wrote in a note on August 18.
Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the key numbers to watch out for:
Here’s what Wall Street expects of Nvidia in the quarter, per data from Bloomberg, versus how it performed in the same quarter last year.
Revenue: $11.04 billion expected versus $6.70 billion in Q2 last year.
Adjusted EPS: $2.07 expected versus $0.52 in Q2 last year.
Data center revenue: $7.98 billion expected versus $3.81 billion in Q2 last year.
Gaming revenue: $2.38 billion expected versus $2.04 billion in Q2 last year.
Netflix revenue initiatives set to boost growth, says analyst
The Netflix (NFLX) bulls are turning even more bullish.
Shares of the streaming platform jumped on Wednesday, rising more than 4.5% amid a broader tech rally as analysts continue to champion the streaming giant's crackdown on password sharing and its new ad-supported tier.
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein published a note to clients on Tuesday arguing both initiatives should boost 2025 revenue by 40% compared to 2022 at ""very high incremental margins.""
""We think the complexity of the multiple drivers are being under-appreciated by investors, as we have only seen 2% of the benefit so far,"" Helfstein wrote, adding these initiatives create ""a clear path back to double-digit revenue growth.""
The analyst estimated revenue from stopping paid sharing and ad-supported subscribers will increase from 1% in the second quarter to 17% of Netflix's top line by the end of 2025.
""Our estimates imply Netflix directly recaptures 46% of the total estimated 100 million account sharers by the end of 2025. Given the partial rollout of paid sharing yielded ~6 million subs in one month, we believe there is upside to our above consensus 2024 net add estimate of ~24 million,"" Helfstein wrote.
Helfstein expects the company will add 63 million new subscribers by 2025.

Survey says — The US economy continues to lose momentum
The initial read on economic activity in August from S&P Global out Wednesday pointed to a further loss of momentum in the US economy.
The firm's services PMI reached a six-month low at 51.0 while its manufacturing PMI came in at 47.5, a two-month low. For these surveys, readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector while readings below 50 indicate contraction.
""A near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of US economic growth in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""The survey shows that the service sector-led acceleration of growth in the second quarter has faded, accompanied by a further fall in factory output.""
Williamson added the report shows companies see ""demand [that] is looking increasingly lethargic in the face of high prices and rising interest rates,"" though notes a softening in demand could help inflation pressures continue to ease somewhat.
In recent months, survey data like S&P and the ISM's PMI reports have suggested a softening in economic conditions more dramatic than what has been seen in the monthly jobs reports, retail sales data, and GDP reads.

Kohl's, Foot Locker, Peloton, and AMC: Stocks trending in premarket trading
Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page in premarket trading on Wednesday:
Kohl's (KSS): Kohl’s shares were up 3% after reporting earnings that beat estimates in the second quarter, though profits were down 53% compared to a year ago.
Foot Locker (FL): Shares in the sportswear company plummeted 30% on Wednesday during premarket trading. The retailer told investors it would suspend its quarterly dividend payments following weaker-than-expected second quarter sales and a lower full-year profit outlook.
Peloton (PTON): The connected fitness company saw shares fall more than 25% after reporting fourth quarter results that disappointed with subscriber churn rising and costs from a seat post recall coming in higher than the company had expected.
AMC (AMC): Shares in the entertainment company continued to fall on Wednesday, losing as much as 20% in premarket trading ahead of a share conversion that will see its common and preferred stock merged into a single share class.","Tech stocks rally, yields drop, ahead of Nvidia earnings: Stock market news today",456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

Stocks jumped out of the gate Wednesday and never looked back as optimism built ahead of this evening's earnings report from major chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NVDA). Before this major event, market participants took in another batch of mixed retail earnings and some disappointing economic data.
Retailers continued to dominate earnings headlines ahead of tonight's results from Nvidia. Foot Locker (FL), for one, saw its share price slide 28.3% after the athletic footwear retailer unveiled its second-quarter results.
While the company reported in-line earnings of 4 cents per share, revenue of $1.9 billion fell short of estimates. Additionally, Foot Locker lowered its full-year guidance due to ""softening trends"" in consumer spending the retailer saw in July, and said it will pause its dividend after the upcoming October payout.
""For a second consecutive quarter, Foot Locker significantly slashed their guidance,"" says Edward Moya, senior market strategist at currency data provider OANDA.""Wall Street was already skeptical of how Foot Locker would finish the year, but the outlook just went from bad to abysmal. A tough consumer backdrop is only going to get worse, which could lead to a few ugly quarters for the footwear chain.""
Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), on the other hand, jumped 23.5% after the teen clothing retailer's beat-and-raise report. In the second quarter, ANF swung to a profit of $1.10 per share vs a per-share loss of 33 cents in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped 16.2% to $935.3 million, while same-store sales were up 13%. The company is also targeting full-year sales growth of 10% vs its previous estimate of 2% to 4% growth.
A first look at Nvidia earnings
Still, folks spent the day with one eye trained on NVDA stock, which rose 3.2% ahead of its after-the-close earnings announcement. Shares are up 7% in after-hours trading after the chipmaker disclosed its results. In its second quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of $2.70 per share vs earnings of 51 cents per share in the year-ago period. Revenue of $13.5 billion doubled from the year-ago period and was a record – driven by a 141% quarter-over-quarter surge in data center revenue.
""A new computing era has begun,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, in the company's press release. ""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.""
In Nvidia's Q2 earnings call, slated to kick off at 5 pm Eastern time today, ""[i]nvestors will be laser-focused on NVDA's comments regarding its ability to meet hyper-demand for its AI chips, and whether the runaway growth in AI can persist at this pace,"" says Greg Bassuk, CEO at asset management firm AXS Investments. ""As NVDA remains a front-runner in fueling the skyrocketing AI explosion, investors will be looking under-the-hood at NVDA's outlook for the AI space for the months and year ahead.""
Manufacturing activity continues to decline
On the economic front, S&P Global said its flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 47.0 in August from July's reading of 49.0. Its services PMI dropped to 51.0 from last month's reading of 52.3, a six-month low. Additionally, ""cost pressures regained some momentum as the rate of input price inflation quickened on the back of greater fuel, wage and raw material costs,"" S&P Global wrote in its report.
""This morning's August PMI shows that services continued expanding in the U.S., but almost slipped into contraction territory,"" says José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers. ""Manufacturing, meanwhile, continued its sobering downward slide, an ongoing issue that started after central banks began raising interest rates.""
The dreary economic data did little to halt today's broad-market rally. At the close, the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6% at 13,721, the S&P 500 was 1.1% higher at 4,436, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.5% to 34,472.

(Reuters) -Chip designer Nvidia on Wednesday forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street targets and said it will buy back $25 billion more of its shares as sales benefit from soaring demand for its chips that power nearly all the world's major artificial-intelligence apps.
Shares of the Santa-Clara, California-based company rose 8% in trading after the bell, hitting an all-time high.
Nvidia's forecast beat expectations by billions of dollars, demonstrating that a boom in generative AI technologies that can read and write in human-like ways - and powered almost exclusively by Nvidia's chips - shows no signs of slowing down.
Nvidia's additional $25 billion in share repurchases announced on Wednesday come as shares have already tripled this year, making the company the first ever trillion-dollar chip business as investors bet Nvidia will be the key beneficiary of the AI boom.
Analysts have estimated that demand for Nvidia's prized AI chips is exceeding supply by at least 50%, adding that the imbalance will stay in place for the next several quarters.
""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said in a statement.
Nvidia's report lifted the shares of other Big Tech stocks and AI-related companies, with Microsoft jumping 2.4%, Meta Platforms up 1.2% and Palantir Technologies surging 4.2% in extended trading on Wednesday.
From AI startups to major cloud services providers like Microsoft, all are looking to get their hands on more Nvidia chips. Demand from China is also in overdrive, as companies there are placing rush orders to stockpile chips before any further U.S. export curbs come into action.
The company forecast third-quarter revenue of about $16 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts polled by Refinitiv on average were expecting $12.61 billion.
Adjusted revenue in the second quarter was $13.51 billion, compared with estimates of $11.22 billion.
Revenue at the company’s data center business rose 141% to $10.32 billion in the quarter ended July 30, beating analyst estimates of $7.69 billion by more than $2 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
""Its Q2 results underscore its dominant position in harnessing the AI momentum,"" said Insider Intelligence senior analyst Jacob Bourne. ""Yet as global appetite for Nvidia's chips intensifies, navigating supply chain hurdles to boost production is essential.""
To that end, Nvidia is spending big to secure supply. The company reported a 53% jump to $11.15 billion of inventory commitments from the previous quarter, largely because of the long-term supply needs for its data center chips.
Analysts expect revenue from Nvidia's data center segment to expand to as much as $40 billion for its fiscal 2025, according to Refinitiv estimates, driven by Nvidia's edge in AI chips and other related technologies such as the software to put those chips to work to power products like ChatGPT.
While rival Advanced Micro Devices' key AI chip is expected to pry away some market share from Nvidia next year, Nvidia’s software has a years' long lead over its CUDA competitor called ROCm, analysts believe.
Sales of chips destined for personal computers and data centers have been weak in recent months, which has hurt the chip industry. But AI is a bright spot, with cloud computing businesses and startups alike buying up AI-related chips from Nvidia and others such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology.
Analysts expect AI spending to continue growing at the expense of other traditional server equipment.
Revenue at Nvidia's gaming segment rose to $2.49 billion, above analyst estimates of $2.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.70 per share in the second quarter, compared with estimates of $2.09, according to Refinitiv data.
For the current third quarter, Nvidia expects adjusted gross margin to be 72.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Analysts on average forecast gross margin to be 70.4%, according to Refinitiv data.

NVDA,2023-08-23 20:26:22,"Nvidia reported its second quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday that again blew away estimates, sending shares to a record high in after hours trading.","Nvidia (NVDA) reported second quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday that blew away already sky high expectations for the graphics chip giant as the AI hype train keeps pushing markets forward.
The company reported revenue of $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year, while adjusted earnings came in at $2.70 per share, up 429% from last year. Analysts had expected revenue to come in at $11.04 billion with earnings per share totaled $2.07, according to data from Bloomberg.
Nvidia also issued current quarter revenue guidance of $16 billion, plus or minus 2%, far outpacing Wall Street's already lofty expectations for $12.5 billion in revenue.
Shares of the graphics chipmaker rose as much as 9% in after hours trading on Wednesday to a record high of $515 per share.
Nvidia's report had been seen as a key test for the ongoing AI hype cycle, which has pushed companies of all stripes to dive into the technology in hopes of cashing in on the mania. But none has seen the actual fortunes of their business change to extent already being enjoyed by Nvidia.
""A new computing era has begun,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.""
By segment, Nvidia reported data center revenue of $10.3 billion and gaming revenues of $2.5 billion, topping forecasts for $8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. The company also announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan and said it intends to buyback stock during its current fiscal year.
Investors were already expecting Nvidia to deliver a blowout quarter, after the company said revenue in its latest would be about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%.
Huang added: ""During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI.""
Software giant Snowflake (SNOW) also reported earnings after the bell on Wednesday that topped expectations, which, combined with Nvidia's upbeat print, sent a slew of AI-related stocks higher in after-hours trading.
C3.ai (AI), Palantir (PLTR), Marvell Technology (MRVL), and MongoDB (MDB) all jumped more than 3% in post-market trade. C3.ai and MongoDB had been down roughly 10% over the past month prior to the report. Snowflake's stock rose more than 3% in Wednesday's after hours session.
The rapid increase in demand for Nvidia's chips lead some on Wall Street to question whether its key supplier TSMC could produce as many graphics processors as Nvidia's customers needed.
The AI craze kicked into high gear in November 2022 when OpenAI debuted its generative AI app, ChatGPT.
While artificial intelligence has been around for some time, ChatGPT's popularity as one of the fastest-growing apps in history put the technology firmly on Wall Street’s radar.
Since then, tech companies ranging from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Meta (META) have debuted or announced that they’re working on their own generative AI tools and software.

The shares soared more than 7% in extended trading after Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October. Analyst had estimated just $12.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia also approved an additional $25 billion in stock buybacks.
The outlook underscores Nvidia’s role as the key beneficiary of the AI computing boom. Faced with a surge in demand for chatbots and other tools, data center operators are stocking up on the company’s processors, which are adept at handling the heavy workloads required by artificial intelligence. That’s helped Nvidia quickly pull out of an industrywide chip slump and accelerate sales growth to its fastest rate in years.
The shares had closed at $471.16 in New York trading, already up more than threefold this year.
In the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 30, revenue doubled to $13.5 billion. Profit was $2.70 a share, minus certain items. Analysts had predicted sales of about $11 billion and profit of $2.07.
Nvidia became the first-ever semiconductor company to rack up a $1 trillion market valuation after a blowout quarter in May. It has emerged as the key supplier of infrastructure needed to support the growing use of AI systems. But investors have been waiting for more evidence that the second quarter was the beginning of a long-term expansion and not a one-time spike.
Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, who still runs the company. He’s successfully parlayed a business making graphics chips for video games into dominance of the market for so-called accelerators — chips that help train AI software by bombarding it with data. Nvidia’s rapid introduction of ever-more powerful processors — along with accompanying software — has left would-be rivals trailing far behind. Customers such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s. Google, meanwhile, are lining up to take as many chips as Nvidia can supply.
Like many of its peers, Nvidia doesn’t operate its own chip production and relies on outsourced manufacturing provided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. That arrangement frees it from the huge expenditure and risks of investing in manufacturing. But it also gives it less ability to adjust supply quickly.
Nvidia’s division that supplies chips to data centers — once a sideline business — has become its biggest moneymaker. The unit had sales of $10.3 billion last quarter, versus an estimate of $7.98 billion. Gaming revenue was $2.49 billion, compared with an average analyst prediction of $2.38 billion. Automotive-related chips brought in $253 million.

AI has been the hottest topic for tech investors this year, and every major company has talked up its capabilities in that area. But Nvidia is one of the few making serious money from the trend, which has accelerated since the public debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. That tool helped show the stunning potential of generative AI to a broader audience.
Nvidia’s stock run-up of more than 200% this year has eclipsed the gains of all others in the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.
Nvidia also has become more important as a tech industry bellwether. The chipmaker’s forecasts provide a window into the plans of some of the world’s most valuable companies — and indicate how much those businesses are willing to spend to overhaul computer systems to accommodate AI.
Other chipmakers, meanwhile, are striving to catch up with Nvidia in AI processors, including top PC chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. But Nvidia has continued to upgrade its products and release related software and services, aiming to keep its edge.

AI may have to boost US productivity growth to justify the high price of stocks, Bill Gross says.
The surge in interest rates is putting downward pressure on the stock market, the ""Bond King"" says.
Investors have piled into technology stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla this year, as they expect artificial intelligence to revolutionize the US economy. The stock market has priced in those high hopes, putting investors at risk if the nascent tech doesn't live up to their expectations, Bill Gross has warned.
""Could AI increase a historical productivity growth rate in the US economy from 2% to 3%?"" Gross asked in a X post on Tuesday. ""It may need to in order to justify current stock prices at today's real interest rate levels.""
The billionaire investor and PIMCO cofounder was making the point that higher interest rates typically pull down stock prices, yet the market has rallied strongly this year despite the Federal Reserve hiking rates from virtually zero to over 5% since last spring.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have surged 14% and 29% respectively since the start of January, and both indices touched their highest levels in more than a year in July. Their gains have confounded experts, as higher rates lessen the appeal of stocks relative to safer assets like bonds, increase companies' debt costs, and can erode demand across the economy, reducing corporate profits.
Public companies are generally valued at a multiple to their earnings, meaning their stock prices usually fall if their profits shrink, or if investors can earn a nice return from other assets and place less of a premium on stocks. Higher rates can lead to both outcomes.
Gross' point is that AI might have to accelerate US productivity growth from its historical average of 2% to 3% to warrant the heady valuations of stocks today, at a time when higher rates are weighing on them.
The investor — whose nickname is the ""Bond King"" — has been skeptical of the AI-fueled surge in stocks for a while.
""Exciting doubles match currently in stock market,"" he posted on X in late July. ""AI and market momentum vs China/US slowdown and negative curve persisting. I pick the latter.""
Gross also suggested recently that Apple and other high-flying stocks needed a breather following their strong gains this year. Moreover, he said that he preferred owning Activision Blizzard to Nvidia, one of the hottest AI-related stocks on the market.
On the other hand, Gross has slammed GameStop for ""becoming technologically obsolete"" in contrast to many AI companies, and touted OpenAI's ChatGPT tool.","Stocks are pricing in an AI revolution, putting investors at risk of disappointment, Bill Gross says",456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

QQQ Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Forecast: Markets Wrap
The chipmaker surged as much as 10% in late trading after delivering sales that topped its own lofty projections on the strength of demand for all things AI. Other chipmakers rallied in tow, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. adding more than 3%. The biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 rose more than 1% after the underlying index gained 1.6% during the cash session.
On track for its worst month of the year and offering investors little reason for optimism just days ago, the Nasdaq 100 now has a chance to shift course as Nvidia’s results allay, for now, worries that tech valuations have become unmoored from reality. After roaring to its best first half on record amid speculation AI will deliver riches to a swath of tech giants, the index slumped for three weeks as investors fretted over the threat of a recession and rising bond yields.
Nvidia’s results show “that betting on AI is paying off today,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. “This is a big deal because it validates the narrative that has been propping tech stocks in general this year.”
Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October. Analysts had estimated roughly $12.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia also approved an additional $25 billion in stock buybacks.
After falling 4% from a peak last month, the Nasdaq 100 is priced at 24 times projected profits for the year. That’s down from 27 times in July, but above the benchmark’s average of 21 times over the past decade.

The bold call comes from Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who offered four reasons why he expects stocks to rise soon.
""While rates could be pushing higher, equities are showing early signs of diverging from higher rates.""
It's been a tough few weeks for the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 down about 5% in August, but Fundstrat's Tom Lee sees a buying opportunity.
In a note to clients on Wednesday, Lee said today is the day to add risk to portfolios and buy stocks ahead of two big market-moving events: Nvidia's earnings report after the market close on Wednesday, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium Friday morning.
The bold call comes amid a surge in interest rates, in which the 10-year US Treasury yield surged 50 basis points over the past few weeks to levels not seen since 2007.
""Despite this rise in rates, we believe probabilities have shifted to favor stocks being higher in the short term. That is, we would be buyers of equities starting Wednesday, even if we are only in 'close proximity' to a low,"" Lee said.
These are the four reasons why now is the time to buy stocks, right before two big market-shaking events, according to Fundstrat.
1. Stocks typically do well after Jackson Hole.
Lee analyzed market performance in the week after Jackson Hole speeches, and found that stocks typically move higher, not lower.
""Our analysis suggests there is a greater than 80% [chance] equities rally post-Friday,"" he said.
Looking at data since 2003, Lee found seven instances in which the S&P 500 was down in the two weeks prior to the Fed speech, similar to what the current stock market looks like.
In six of those seven instances, stocks gained in the week after Jackson Hole by 0.5%-5%. One exception was last year, when Powell was especially hawkish.
""The context is different in 2023, as inflation is not only on a glide path lower, but the surge in 10-year yields threatens a potentially greater tightening of financial conditions and thus, we see probabilities favoring language addressing this surge in yields,"" Lee said.
2. New data could put pressure on inflation.
New data show pay for new hires declined versus a year ago. Meanwhile, auto-loan delinquencies are up, likely putting pressure on car prices.
""We previously wrote how used car prices could fall another 30% from here. All of this argues for future inflation to be softer and for Fed path to turn dovish sooner,"" he said.
3. Stocks are diverging from rates.
When interest rates surged earlier this week to their highest level in more than a decade, technology stocks actually moved higher, not lower.
""This is a somewhat important development, if this is due to stocks sensing rates are about to roll over. Our view is a calculated bet that stocks are rising, despite higher rates, because the stock market is sensing this turn,"" Lee said. ""We are saying the last push higher in rates will not proportionately hit stocks.""
4. Upcoming data could ease inflation concerns.
A lot of economic data is due next week, including Case-Shiller Home prices, job openings, and second-quarter GDP revisions. And Lee is bullish that it will paint a clearer picture that inflation is indeed moving lower, which means there should be less upside pressure on interest rates.
""Our view is this will support the picture of a glide path to lower inflation and a softening labor market. Given the hawkish shift in investor expectations, I think this would further support a rise in equities,"" Lee said. ""Our constructive stance on buying 'risk' on Wednesday is that the bull market is intact.""",4 reasons why investors should buy stocks now ahead of Nvidia earnings and Powell's Jackson Hole speech,456.67999,471.16,471.63,8,2023,23

Equity futures for Japan, Australia and Hong Kong all rose Thursday, echoing a rally in US equities. The S&P 500 closed 1.1% higher, its best day since June, while the Nasdaq 100 rose 1.6%. Those gains were compounded in early Asia trading as futures contracts for the two benchmarks jumped on bullish earnings from Nvidia Corp.
The chip-maker, a major constituent of both US benchmarks, rose in extended trading following earnings that forecast quarterly sales to reach $16 billion, eclipsing the $12.5 billion anticipated by analysts.
“There’s been an ongoing debate on whether Nvidia is even more important to the broad trajectory of markets than Fed Chair Powell’s comments from Jackson Hole on Friday,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.
Treasury yields retreated across the curve. The 10-year yield fell 13 basis points after touching a 2007 high this week, while the policy-sensitive two-year yields declined eight basis points to below 5%. The drop in yields weighed on the greenback and comes ahead of Powell’s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole symposium.
Jackson Hole
The Fed chair is expected to outline the final steps in the central bank’s inflation-fighting campaign following weeks of pressure on stocks and government bonds, which has increased borrowing costs for businesses and households.
“The recent surge in bond yields has pushed up mortgage and corporate borrowing rates, contributed to the fall in stock prices, and generated upward pressures on the dollar,” said Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI. “The Fed will have to consider the tightening in financial conditions when setting rates in coming months, including the decision on whether to hike in September.”
Wednesday data offered support for a pause. Flash purchasing managers index data for August came in softer than expected. US mortgage applications for home purchases tumbled to an almost three-decade low. A US government report also said that job growth in the year through March will probably be revised down by around 300,000.
In Asia, investors will be keenly watching the daily People’s Bank of China yuan fixing after record levels of official support for the currency, which has weakened on China’s economic outlook. The country’s $2.9 trillion trust industry is also showing signs of strain, adding further pressure on the economy.
Meituan and China CITIC Bank Corp are among the Chinese blue-chips to release earnings, while in Australia, Qantas Airways reported a record annual profit.
Elsewhere in corporate news, Esmark Inc. said it won’t make a takeover offer for US Steel Corp. and WeWork Inc. is rounding up advisers for help with a restructuring as it struggles with a heavy debt load, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
In commodities, crude oil declined while gold edged higher.

VNG, which plans to offer almost 22 million shares in the IPO, will set a proposed price range in a later filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It said in its filing Wednesday that VNG will continue to be controlled by its founders, Le Hong Minh and Vuong Quang Khai. VNG will own 49% of VNG Corp., the Vietnamese operating company.
Formerly known as Vinagame, VNG Corp. had its start as a game publisher in 2004. It develops and publishes its own titles as well as local versions of international hits, and has gradually expanded to a wide range of services, such as music sharing, video streaming, messaging, a news portal and mobile payments. It has been exploring going public in the US since at least 2017.
Its messaging app, Zalo, has won over Meta Platform Inc.’s Facebook Messenger to become the most-used chatting platform in Vietnam since 2020. Zalo has 75 million monthly active users, according to a statement.
“We were born after the war, in a nation that had found peace and unity, but was still struggling with underdevelopment and isolation,” VNG’s founders said in a letter to investors included in the prospectus. “Little did we know how lucky we were when the Internet arrived in Vietnam in the middle of the 1990s. The world magically and suddenly opened the door for us.”
VNG Ltd.’s IPO would follow this month’s US debut of Vietnamese electric-vehicle maker Vinfast Auto Ltd. after it completed a merger with blank-check company Black Spade Acquisition Co. in a deal valuing it at $23 billion.
A listing by VNG would add momentum to an IPO market that has been warming in fits and starts. Chip designer Arm Holdings Ltd., majority owned by SoftBank Group Corp., is planning to go public in September in what would be the year’s biggest IPO. San Francisco-based grocery delivery firm Instacart Inc. and marketing, data automation provider Klaviyo and footwear maker Birkenstock are also preparing to file for IPOs, Bloomberg News has reported.
VNG sees games as the spearhead of its global expansion plans while also seeking to add revenue from artificial intelligence and cloud computing products, Minh, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an interview last year. The gaming arm VNGGames has at least 9 studio games abroad including Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Taipei and China.
The offering is being led by Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG and Bank of America Corp. The company plans for its shares to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol VNG.

QQQ Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Forecast: Markets Wrap
Goldman Is Cracking Down on Employees That Aren't in Office Five Days a Week
The shares soared more than 6% in extended trading after Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October. Analysts had estimated just $12.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia’s results last quarter also blew past projections, and it approved an additional $25 billion in stock buybacks.
The outlook underscores Nvidia’s role as the key beneficiary of the AI computing boom. Faced with skyrocketing demand for chatbots and other tools, data center operators are stocking up on the company’s processors, which are adept at handling the heavy workloads required by artificial intelligence. That’s helped Nvidia quickly pull out of an industrywide chip slump and accelerate sales growth to its fastest rate in years.
“A new computing era has begun,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement. Companies around the world are shifting to more powerful computing that can handle ChatGPT-style generative AI, he said.
The post-market gain adds to a more than threefold increase for the stock this year. The shares had closed at $471.16 in New York on Wednesday before Nvidia released its quarterly report.
In the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 30, revenue doubled to $13.5 billion, the company said. Profit was $2.70 a share, minus certain items. Analysts had predicted sales of about $11 billion and profit of $2.07.
Nvidia became the first-ever semiconductor company to rack up a $1 trillion market valuation after another blowout quarter in May. It has emerged as the main supplier of infrastructure needed to support the growing use of AI systems. But investors have been waiting for more evidence that the second quarter was the beginning of a long-term expansion and not a one-time spike. What they got Wednesday was even more bullish than hoped.
Underscoring Nvidia’s dramatic growth, this quarter’s revenue target is 28% above Wall Street projections and nearly as high as the company’s total annual sales in 2021.
Another milestone: Nvidia’s quarterly sales overtook those of Intel Corp. for the first time. Though Nvidia has had a higher valuation than Intel since 2020, posting more revenue than the chip pioneer shows just how pervasive its products have become.
Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Huang, who still runs the company. He’s successfully parlayed a business making graphics chips for video games into dominance of the market for so-called accelerators — chips that help train AI software by bombarding it with data. Nvidia’s rapid introduction of ever-more powerful processors — along with accompanying software — has left would-be rivals trailing far behind. Customers such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s. Google, meanwhile, are lining up to take as many chips as Nvidia can supply.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“A significant 2Q beat and raise, a repeat of 1Q’s performance, suggests sustained demand strength in Nvidia’s Data Center (DC) business, while guidance 29% above consensus for 3Q implies the company may get its hands on better-than-expected supply. Gross-margin upside (112 bps above consensus) is likely to continue as the DC contribution rises.”
— Kunjan Sobhani, BI technology industry analyst

Like many of its peers, Nvidia doesn’t operate its own chip production and relies on outsourced manufacturing provided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. That arrangement frees it from the huge expenditure and risks of investing in manufacturing. But it also gives it less ability to adjust supply quickly.
There were concerns that supply constraints could hamper Nvidia’s sales in the current quarter, but its forecast suggests that operations are running smoothly. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company is happy with the progress it’s making in getting more components.
“We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year,” she told analysts on a conference call.
Nvidia’s division that supplies chips to data centers — once a sideline business — has become its biggest moneymaker. The unit had sales of $10.3 billion last quarter, versus an estimate of $7.98 billion. Gaming revenue was $2.49 billion, compared with an average analyst prediction of $2.38 billion. Automotive-related chips brought in $253 million.
The personal computer market, previously Nvidia’s largest source of revenue, had slumped in the past year. But it has returned to being a growth driver. Demand for laptop components is particularly strong, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.

AI has been the hottest topic for tech investors this year, and every major company has talked up its capabilities in that area. But Nvidia is one of the few making serious money from the trend, which has accelerated since the public debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. That tool helped show the potential of generative AI to a broader audience.
Nvidia’s stock run-up of more than 200% this year has eclipsed the gains of all others in the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.
The company’s gains are all the more remarkable because it can’t sell its full lineup to the largest chip market, China. The US government requires Nvidia to obtain licenses to supply Chinese customers with its best-performing AI-related chips.
The announcement of that rule last year put a dent in shipments to the Asian nation and forced Nvidia to rework one of its key products: The company depowered one of its graphics processor units, or GPUs, to make sure it didn’t trigger the China restriction. But the Biden administration is considering new regulations that could limit sales of that component as well, Bloomberg has reported.
Nvidia’s CFO addressed that possibility Wednesday on the call.
“Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results,” she said. “However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets.”
Nvidia also has become more important as a tech industry bellwether. The chipmaker’s forecasts provide a window into the plans of some of the world’s most valuable companies — and indicate how much those businesses are willing to spend to overhaul computer systems to accommodate AI.
Other chipmakers, meanwhile, are striving to catch up with Nvidia in AI processors, including top PC chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel. But Nvidia has continued to upgrade its products and release related software and services, aiming to keep its edge.

More than 150 staff at parts of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG operations will decide whether to endorse an agreement reached with the company after a 15-hour meeting on Wednesday, the Offshore Alliance — a group that represents two major unions — said by email. They will also vote on whether to withdraw a notice of industrial action.
Workers at various Chevron Corp. operations in Australia are continuing to negotiate in two separate disputes that also carry a threat of potential strike action. A ballot on approving industrial action — a key step before any strikes can be triggered — is scheduled to be completed Thursday at the Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities and on Aug. 28 at Wheatstone platforms.
“It’s pleasing that Woodside has made our members a strong offer without industrial action being taken,” Offshore Alliance spokesperson Brad Gandy said in a statement. “Despite the lengthy road to this point, we are relieved that Woodside has now taken a more pragmatic approach and decided to offer our members an enterprise agreement with industry standard terms and conditions.”
Woodside said “substantial progress” had been made in the talks, and confirmed unions had not triggered an option to give the required seven working days’ notice to begin a strike. Workers at Woodside’s North West Shelf operations have been locked in discussions with the producer on demands around pay and other conditions for months.
“If Offshore Alliance members at the Woodside NWS Platforms accept this deal it will leave Chevron as the sole operator in the Western Australia gas fields without an Enterprise Agreement with its workforce,” the Offshore Alliance said Thursday. “However, we don’t think Chevron will be alone in that endeavor for long.”
Strikes at the Woodside and Chevron facilities threaten as much as 10% of global LNG supply, and prices in Europe and Asia have surged this month on the prospect of action.
Benchmark European natural gas prices sank 14% on Wednesday to erase most of the gains over the prior two sessions.

Regional securities have fared better even though their emerging-market counterparts have had the benefit of monetary easing as central banks start cutting rates. There are multiple factors working in favor of Asian notes including a lower correlation to US yields, support from resilient currencies and disinflationary pressures exported by China.
The average 90-day correlation between yields in emerging Asia ex China versus Treasuries stands at close to zero. In comparison, the same measure for yields in Europe, the Middle East and Africa is at 0.32, and 0.36 for Latin America, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.
While the rapidity of the rise in US yields is challenging bond investors globally, “in Asia, there is a cold counter-cyclical wind coming from China, which has a much more significant impact on emerging Asian economies that supports the local bond markets,” said Rajeev De Mello, a Geneva-based global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA.
This trend may prompt investors to rethink their bullish bets on emerging market bonds that were based on expectations these curves would shift lower as rate cuts pick up pace. Central banks in Chile, Brazil and Hungary have lowered key rates this quarter while Peru, Colombia, Mexico, the Czech and Poland are all expected to join the easing bandwagon later this year, according economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
In contrast, central banks in Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, India and South Korea are forecast to keep rates unchanged this year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Still, an average of 10-year benchmark yields from emerging Asia ex-China has risen 21 basis points this quarter, less than the 26 basis points gain recorded in EMEA and 53 basis points increase in Latin America, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Latin American and Central and Eastern European currencies have also underperformed, falling by at least 0.9% versus the greenback this quarter, while Asian currencies have declined by around 0.7%. The relative strength of Asia’s currencies helps boost the appeal of the region’s assets.
Asian yields are anchored by various factors including a stable or sanguine bond supply outlook, as well as a dovish policy rate view, said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “Despite compressed yield differentials with Treasuries, these differentials may stay narrow,” she added.

West Texas Intermediate traded near $79 a barrel after closing down 1.8% on Wednesday. The Biden administration is in talks with Venezuela to explore a temporary lifting of sanctions that have hindered its oil sales. That comes on top of a surge in exports from Iran this month.
A rally in crude that got underway in late June has faltered over the last couple of weeks due to a deteriorating economic situation in China, the biggest importer, as well as signs US interest rates will need to stay higher for longer. That’s overshadowed a tightening market driven by Saudi Arabian supply cuts.
The curbs have helped drive a sharp slump in global oil inventories over the past month, according to data from Kpler. In the US, crude stockpiles fell by 6.1 million barrels last week to the lowest since December, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

NVDA,2023-08-24 00:33:58,Artificial intelligence powerhouse Nvidia announced a blockbuster earnings report for the company's second quarter along with a $25 billion stock buyback as it rides the AI boom.,"Nvidia exceeded analysts’ expectations with its latest earnings announcement, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) boom on its advanced chips and announcing a $25 billion stock buyback.
Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia has emerged as a powerhouse in the AI space in large part due to its advanced computer chips, which are used in most generative AI apps and the training of large language models that power them. Nvidia’s earnings results from the second quarter of the company’s fiscal year showed that its momentum is continuing to build.
""A new computing era has begun,"" said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO. ""The industry is simultaneously going through two platform transitions: accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing. The trillion dollars of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency and cost.""
NVIDIA ANNOUNCES NEW CHIP TO POWER AI MODELS, REDUCE COSTS
""Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never before possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift,"" he added. ""Nvidia has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world’s industries can build upon.""
Nvidia’s second-quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, beating estimates of $11.2 billion. Its forecast for the third quarter projects a jump to about $16 billion, plus or minus 2%, which exceeded the expectations of analysts polled by Refinitiv, who on average projected $12.6 billion.

The company reported a 53% jump in its inventory commitments from the prior quarter as it looks to meet and secure long-term demand for its data center chips.
""Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding on our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year,"" Huang added.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Colette Kress, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, briefly discussed the impact of restrictions on the export of high-end semiconductors to China.
The current export controls have prompted Nvidia to rework one of its chips so that it can still be sold to customers in China without violating those restrictions – although the U.S. government is weighing additional curbs that Kress said could have a detrimental long-term impact if they’re implemented.
""We believe that the current regulation is achieving the intended result. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets,"" she said.
Nvidia also announced the approval of a $25 billion stock buyback – a boon to shareholders who have seen the company’s stock price surge this year, which drove its market value over the $1 trillion threshold in late May.
Nvidia’s stock was up by 3.17% during Wednesday’s trading session. Following the earnings call after the bell, Nvidia’s stock rose a further 6.8% in after-hours trading – bringing its year-to-date gains to about 229%.","Nvidia continues AI-driven surge, announces $25B stock buyback",471.16,471.63,460.17999,8,2023,24

A gas explosion on Monday at a mine in China’s third-largest coal province killed 11, halting operations there and ending a month-long run of declining prices for thermal coal. It’s the worst accident since February, when a mine collapse in Inner Mongolia claimed 53 lives and triggered nationwide checks on safety.
If regulators respond in similar fashion, it’ll be difficult to keep raising average monthly levels of output, Hou Jian, an analyst at the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association, told a briefing on Wednesday. The association cut its forecast for annual production by almost 100 million tons to 4.6 billion tons.
China mined nearly 4.5 billion tons last year, a record, as Beijing prioritizes production of its mainstay fuel to safeguard energy security after the economy was blighted by power outages in recent years. But the limits of that expansion are becoming apparent, as the quality of coal declines and all-too-frequent accidents hamper operations.
The latest disaster affected coal used by the steel industry and coking coal futures in Dalian have climbed over 8% this week to above 1,500 yuan ($206) a ton. Most of China’s coal goes to power generation and the domestic spot price for the thermal variety inched up to around 820 yuan a ton on Wednesday, after falling for nearly a month, according to CCTD.

China is attempting to diffuse risks from its $9 trillion pile of off balance-sheet local government debt, without resorting to major bailouts.
Three years ago, China cracked down on a booming real estate sector to reduce risk and make homes more affordable — part of President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive.
China’s housing slump is hitting consumption, one reason the recovery has disappointed this year, according to Bloomberg Economics. Spending on home appliances, furniture and building materials has dropped with the property downturn.

The Bloomberg Asia Pacific Semiconductors Index climbed as much as 2.5%, the most since July 11, in early trading Thursday. Gains were led by two Nvidia suppliers seen as among the region’s biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. and Japan’s Advantest Corp., which jumped at least 5% each. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. rose 2%.
Nvidia’s results for the latest quarter and its outlook for the current period trumped analyst expectations on a surge in demand for its AI processors. The emerging technology helped the US chipmaker overcome a slump in more traditional semiconductor business, thrusting its share price to more than triple its value so far in 2023.
The blowout results sent Nvidia shares soaring 10% in extended US trading. The jump provided a fresh tailwind for Asian chip stocks, helping the Bloomberg Asia chip gauge pare declines from a June high. The measure is still up 19% year to date.
“Nvidia’s post-market surge is favorable,” said Seo Sang Young, a strategist at Mirae Asset Securities Co. “It has raised expectations for the AI industry that it isn’t just a temporary theme.”

Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress, speaking on a conference call with analysts late Wednesday, argued that existing curbs on the sale of AI chips and high-end components were already having the desired effect. The company is currently prohibited from offering its high-end graphics processing unit, or GPU, in the country — though it sells a less powerful version of the chip in China.
“Over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our data center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of an opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets,” Kress said following Nvidia’s earnings announcement. The finance chief said she was addressing reports on the potential for increased regulations “on our exports to China.”

In the more immediate term, though, stricter rules wouldn’t take a heavy toll on Nvidia’s finances, she said.
“Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results,” Kress said.
Kress’s boss, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, recently joined counterparts from Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. in a visit to Washington to argue for a pause in escalations of export controls. The Biden administration says restrictions are needed to safeguard US national interests and prevent the advancement of China’s military.
Bloomberg has reported that further restrictions are being considered that would limit Nvidia’s ability to ship to the Asian nation — the biggest market for semiconductors.

Nvidia, benefiting from an industrywide race toward artificial intelligence computing, delivered a third-straight sales forecast that surpassed Wall Street estimates Wednesday. That fueled a 6% share rally in late trading. The company gets about two-thirds of its sales from outside the US, though it doesn’t disclose revenue in China.
The leading association of global chip companies, meanwhile, is warning that Huawei Technologies Co. is building a collection of secret semiconductor-fabrication facilities across China — a shadow manufacturing network that would let the blacklisted company skirt US sanctions and further the nation’s technology ambitions — Bloomberg News has reported.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Thursday after blockbuster results from tech darling Nvidia boosted Wall Street and a retreat in U.S. bond yields eased pressure on borrowing costs globally.
A round of soft surveys on manufacturing had also revived hopes central banks were done tightening, though that might change depending on what clues about interest rates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives at an annual central bank summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.
""Equities rallied and bond yields retreated as flash PMI data for August signalled weaker economic activity in the U.S., euro area and UK, fuelling market expectations that central banks may not have to raise rates again,"" said analysts at ANZ in a note.
""This week's Jackson Hole Symposium remains firmly in focus for markets ... We expect (Powell) will err on the side of caution with respect to inflation, noting some signs of improvement but still with a long way to go.""
Investors will also be monitoring interest rate decisions and policy guidance from South Korea and Indonesia on Thursday.
Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.7%, also lifted by Nvidia's bullish outlook.
The index is however down 8.1% so far this month due to the weakness in China's economy and yuan, as well as some gloomy factory readings from Japan, which also left sentiment fragile.

Australian shares edged up 0.27%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.23%.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.51% higher in early trade. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened up 0.82%.
On Wednesday, U.S. stocks ended sharply higher across the board as shares of Nvidia jumped nearly 10% in trading after the bell, hitting an all-time high after it forecast third-quarter revenue well above Wall Street targets.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.54%, the S&P 500 gained 1.10% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.59%.
In U.S. Treasuries, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes reached 4.1879% compared with its U.S. close of 4.198% on Wednesday when it eased from near 16-year highs after weak business activity data from the United States and the euro zone.

The token logged its biggest one-day increase for the past six weeks on Wednesday, making up some of the losses from last week’s nosedive. Ether also moved up to challenge the US$1,700 resistance level, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher. The rise across cryptocurrencies mirrored a rally in the U.S. equity market on Thursday. S&P Global’s purchasing manager’s index for August showed a slowdown in the U.S. economy, mitigating inflation and rate hike concerns.
Solana’s SOL led the crypto winners after Solana Pay announced a partnership with Shopify to allow USDC payments on the e-commerce platform. The Forkast 500 NFT index fell as OpenSea’s decision to stop enforcing creator royalties continues to impact the market. Meanwhile, U.S. AI chipmaker Nvidia released a better-than-expected earnings report which drove a 6% rise in the firm’s shares and a boost for U.S. equities.
Cryptos benefit from Wall Street gains
Bitcoin rose 2.23% in the last 24 hours to US$26,510.04 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 8.11% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency reached a seven-day high of US$26,786.90 on Wednesday, a jump of over 3.7% from its daily low of US$25,806.99.
The rise in Bitcoin came on the back of a Wall Street rally. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted gains of more than 1% at close of trading Wednesday. That followed the release of S&P Global’s flash U.S. Composite PMI index — a measurement of economic activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors.
The index showed that economic growth in August was close to stalling. Investors were hopeful that a slowdown in consumer spending could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause its cycle of interest rate increases — good news for the crypto market playing out in today’s price increases.
CoinGlass data showed total Bitcoin liquidations at US$39.08 million over the past 24 hours. That included US$9.65 million of long positions — positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise.
It was the first time since August 20 that liquidations on Bitcoin short positions — which totaled US$29.43 — surpassed long position liquidations, indicating an improvement in investor sentiment.
Like Bitcoin, Ether gained. It rose 3.04% to US$1,681.25 but was still down 7.06% over the past seven days.
Bitstamp, a Europe-based crypto exchange, revealed Wednesday it will stop providing Ether staking services to U.S. customers from September 25, citing “current regulatory dynamics” in the country. The exchange previously announced it would suspend trades of seven cryptocurrencies declared securities by the U.S. Securitees and Exchange Commission (SEC) from August 27.
All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher over the past 24 hours. Solana’s SOL token led the winners, jumping 5.35% to US$21.61. But it was still down 5.23% for the week.
Solana Pay, a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain, announced a partnership with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify on Wednesday. The partnership will allow Solana Pay users to use USDC stablecoin for online shopping without intermediary fees. The protocol will also consider adding other payment options such as SOL and BOND in the future, TechCrunch reported on Wednesday.

The company shelved its planned initial public offering in Sydney in May 2021 over concerns that the coronavirus pandemic could cloud its business outlook, Bloomberg News reported at the time. The share sale could have raised A$352 million.

Fixed income offers a 180-basis-point yield premium over the dividend returns from stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the widest in 15 years, and the gap is likely to persist or even widen as traders bet that the era of low rates has come to an end.
Investors willing to make that switch have had to stomach a brutal bond selloff that shows few signs of easing. The latest EPFR Global data suggest that the shift, even if costly in recent months, is happening as debt funds reeled in their 21st consecutive week of inflows, while their stock counterparts recorded outflows of around $2.2 billion. In major markets, investors expect yields to return to levels seen before the global financial crisis.
“Even the investment-grade bonds are giving you equity-like returns,” with half the volatility, Sanjay Guglani, chief executive officer at Silverdale Capital Pte Ltd., a Singapore-based fund manager who manages about $1 billion of assets, told Bloomberg Television. “This is a dawn of a new era for fixed income, we never had such a fantastic yields for almost 20 years.”
Global bonds are offering an average yield of 4.0%, data compiled by Bloomberg show, almost twice as much as the 2.2% dividend return for the MSCI ACWI Index. Fidelity International points out that positive real yields make the case for Treasuries even more compelling.
The next cue for traders is likely to come when the world’s top central bankers gather at the annual Jackson Hole symposium from Thursday to discuss the outlook for monetary policies. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is slated to speak Friday.
The years following the global financial crisis, when policymakers were looking to juice up economies and combat anemic price pressures with ultra-low interest rates, were the heyday for stocks, according to the metric comparing bond yields and dividend yields.
But the relationship reversed in early 2022, as the Fed kicked off its most aggressive tightening campaign in four decades. That’s because investors are betting higher borrowing costs will stymie economic growth and crimp corporate profits.
The prospect that borrowing costs may rise further — with Fed minutes published on Aug. 16 showing rate setters remain largely concerned about inflation — has pummeled equities in recent weeks. MSCI’s gauge of developed and emerging market stocks has fallen over 5% so far this month.
“We are seeing across regions, some shifts from equity to buy high-quality credit,” said Adam Whiteley, head of global credit at London for BNY Mellon Corp.’s Insight Investment. “Under the current environment of higher inflation and economic uncertainty, investors are definitely looking at bonds as a relatively safe asset that can offer an alternative to stocks.”
But, there’s still significant debate over where policy rates are headed. Treasury yields took a tumble on Wednesday as US data trailed economists’ forecasts and Citigroup Inc. noted that a short squeeze may be emerging after the recent ramp-up in bearish bets.
In contrast, equity traders had reason to cheer after a bullish earnings forecast from Nvidia Corp. spurred a rally in S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures. The chipmaker’s shares soared 10% in US post-market trading Wednesday after it delivered a third-straight sales forecast that surpassed Wall Street estimates.
Skeptics also note that Japan is an outlier. Equity funds recorded a 10th week of inflows in the week ended Aug. 16, according to data from EPFR. Meanwhile, debt funds had the biggest inflow in two years in the week ended Aug. 9.
This came on the heels of a move by the Bank of Japan in July to loosen its grip on bond yields — a decision that’s expected to boost the yen over time and make domestic assets more attractive. The positive sentiment pushed the yield spread between the bonds and stocks to near the narrowest in more than two years.
Other than Japan, Asia may offer a value proposition for those arguing the case for equities. Payout ratios in the region are some of the lowest globally, “so the longer-term story for dividend growth for equities here is very compelling,” said Sat Duhra, a fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors.
No Landing
Meanwhile, with the odds of a US recession seen receding and large federal budget deficits increasing the supply of Treasury debt, bond yields have been surging.
Tightening bets are also pushing up rates at the front-end of the curve, with the policy-sensitive two-year Treasury yield exceeding 5% this week.
“We are looking at that bull steepening phase to start to happen and that could actually happen before the Fed even starts cutting,” Christy Tan, Asia Pacific investment strategist at Franklin Templeton, told Bloomberg Television. “There is room for the longer end of the yield curve to actually also continue to deliver income and also yield appreciation.”

Goldman Is Cracking Down on Employees That Aren't in Office Five Days a Week
People with knowledge of Sinopec’s internal affairs said the Chinese refining giant was interested in Bukom for the exposure it can provide in the Singapore market, Asia’s no. 1 pricing, trading and distribution hub for oil products such as gasoline and diesel. They could not be identified due to company policy.
A Sinopec spokesperson declined to comment. A Shell spokesperson said the company has initiated a strategic review of its energy and chemicals assets on Bukom and Jurong Island in Singapore.
“Our strategic review is ongoing and we are exploring several options including divestment,” according to Shell in an email response to questions.
According to people with direct knowledge of the review, discussions with interested parties are in the very preliminary stages, and Shell has yet to make a final decision on the fate of the assets.
The refinery could be sold for a nominal fee, the people said, though a buyer would take on the plant’s liabilities including possible carbon taxes, which together could run past $1 billion. Sinopec, as well as another company that received details of the pricing structure, said there were concerns around the level of uncertainty and risk around the carbon component.
In 2021, Shell planned to build a biofuels plant at Bukom to help meet its own target of halving emissions by 2030. That operation would have focused on producing sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Earlier this year, however, those ideas were dropped.
“This review is in response to the ongoing high grading journey of Shell Group’s Chemicals and Products portfolio over the years, the current challenging market conditions and enhanced capital discipline,” Shell said.
A Page in History
The Bukom plant has a storied past. A store of Russian kerosene in Shell’s infancy, it became Singapore’s first oil refinery, opened in 1961, developing lock-step with the city-state as it rose to become one of the world’s most important hubs for commodity trade, distribution and pricing.
In its heyday, the complex was among Asia’s most advanced refineries, alongside Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Jurong Island plant, turning crude oil into fuels and petrochemicals for the rest of Asia, to be supplied via a key maritime route known as the Malacca Strait.
Decades on, the Bukom facility now pales in size and complexity when compared to mega plants in China and India. Meanwhile, Singapore has ambitions to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
Sinopec, should it bid and succeed, would not be the first Chinese state oil company to bet on Singapore. In 2009, PetroChina acquired a stake in Singapore Petroleum Company, which currently runs a joint-venture oil refinery in the city-state with Chevron.

The decline in interest rates came after economic data showed a slowdown in US business activity earlier this month.

US stocks surged more than 1% on Wednesday while interest rates tumbled after economic data showed slowing US business activity earlier this month.
Data from the S&P Global flash composite output index fell showed the slowest pace of growth in six months, with the manufacturing index falling 1.6 points to 50.4. Meanwhile in Europe, private sector activity declined at the fastest pace since November 2020, according to data from S&P Global.
The decline in interest rates calls into question the underlying strength of the economy, but it also provides some relief for stock prices, as it plays into hopes that the Federal Reserve might be finished with its interest rate hikes.
Investors are awaiting Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report after the market close today, and the company has some high expectations to meet.
Another event on investors' radar this week is Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's Friday speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium. Investors will be looking for any clues from Powell about the future direction of interest rates.
Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. close on Wednesday:
S&P 500: 4,436.13, up 1.11%

We are back to ""bad news is good news"" as soft economic data revived hopes central banks could be more or less done raising interest rates, leading investors to rush into risky assets but with wary eyes on the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium.
Stock markets also got a lift from Nvidia.
The blockbuster earnings and forecast from the stock market darling helped lift AI-related stocks, U.S. futures and Asian equities. MSCI Asia ex-Japan IT Index surged 2.5%, on course for its best day in more than two months.
Nvidia far exceeded expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast on Wednesday as an artificial-intelligence boom fuelled demand for its chips. It also announced a bumper $25 billion buyback programme.
Meanwhile, fresh signs are emerging that U.S. consumer spending is under stress after lacklustre results and forecasts from retailers ranging from Macy's to Foot Locker.
With the European economic calendar bare, the AI craze is likely to help buoy stocks, with futures indicating a higher open and comes at the right time for the pan-European STOXX 600, which is down about 4% and set for its worst monthly performance in the year.
The excitement could be short-lived as worries remain sticky, with a majority of analysts polled by Reuters expecting global stock markets to head for a correction in coming months.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5% but is still on course to clock its worst monthly performance since February.
Investor focus will be on a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole conference on Friday, where traders will parse through his every word to figure out the next steps in monetary policy.
Data on Wednesday showed U.S. business activity approached the stagnation point in August, with growth at its weakest since February, while the downturn in euro zone activity was far deeper than expected. That brought Treasury yields lower, weighing on the U.S. dollar.

Nvidia bets $25 billion that AI boom is far from over
Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said he expects the artificial intelligence boom will last well into next year and made what could be the largest single bet yet in the tech sector to back up his optimism. The company's sales forecast on Wednesday blew past Wall Street's expectations and it said it would buy back another $25 billion of its shares, a move most companies make when their leadership thinks the company is undervalued. Nvidia's stock price, though, has more than tripled this year and was set to hit an all-time high after Wednesday's results.

QQQ Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Forecast: Markets Wrap
Shares rose as much as 9.1%, their biggest intraday jump in nine months, after Chief Executive Officer Choi Soo-yeon introduced several generative AI services at a conference in Seoul Thursday. The news came hours after Nvidia Corp., the go-to provider of AI accelerators, offered another blowout sales forecast and dispelled any fears of waning momentum for the nascent tech.
Choi pointed to Naver’s leading positions in search, shopping and payments, and vowed that the company will prevail as it has done in the 24 years since its founding. “We are well prepared and confident that we will ride this new wave,” Choi said at the conference titled DAN 23.
Naver executives on Thursday demonstrated chatbot Clova X as well as its next-generation search experience, dubbed Cue. Cue is built on the company’s HyperCLOVA X generative AI model to provide summaries in response to complex queries, such as where to stay in a particular city with a 5-year-old child for a holiday. The feature would suggest places and locations with photos, opening hours and reviews, as well as related information such as car rental services. Users would be able to book and pay within the same platform.
The company seeks to reassert its dominance at home as it faces rising threats from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other global internet titans. It should be able to maintain its domestic lead with the help of these new AI tools and also expand its services to markets like Japan, where English isn’t the primary language, NH Investment & Securities Co. analyst Ahn Jaemin wrote in a report ahead of the debut.
Naver has invested more than 1 trillion won ($979 million) across fundamental research and applications of AI in the past five years, according to Choi. It completed its first version of HyperCLOVA in 2021, one of the handful of large language models in the world known to exceed 100 billion parameters and the first that was trained in the Korean language.
Its services will go up against a plethora of AI platforms unfurled in recent months by global technology leaders from OpenAI to Google and China’s Baidu Inc.

The country’s top state lender earlier this month identified a list of 331 non-performing assets with a combined outstanding value of 960 billion rupees ($11.6 billion), according to a note SBI sent to potential investors and seen by Bloomberg News.
Investors that have expressed interest include New York-based Cerberus Capital Management LP, Hong Kong-headquartered SC Lowy, and Avenue Capital Group LLC-backed Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd., said the people who requested anonymity discussing private matters. Other potential local buyers include billionaire Uday Kotak-backed Phoenix ARC Pvt., JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. and Reliance Asset Reconstruction Co., they said.
SBI, ARCIl and JM Financial declined to comment. Cerberus, SC Lowy, Reliance ARC, Phoenix, did not immediately respond to e-mailed queries by Bloomberg.
Identifying bad loans has become a growing practice among Indian lenders after the nation’s central bank released two years ago a report that sought to make the buying and selling of distressed assets more transparent and efficient. India’s banking sector is now in stronger shape after surviving a shadow banking crisis in 2018 that rattled the country’s capital markets.
So far, about four dozen of SBI’s distressed assets have come up for discussions, the people said, adding that investors appear to prefer those with higher outstanding value.
SBI put up 150 distressed assets worth a combined 350 billion rupees in the previous financial year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

BRICS leaders are preparing to invite top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and several other countries to join their bloc in a push to expand its global influence.
The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa agreed to expand the BRICS group at their annual summit being held in Johannesburg this week. It will be the first expansion since 2010. Egypt along with other Middle East nations have been invited to join, although the list was still under discussion late Wednesday, said people familiar with the talks who declined to be named because the discussions are private.
An expansion of the group of emerging market powers could help boost its global heft and counter the dominance of the Group of Seven. China, backed by Russia and South Africa, has been the main driver behind the addition of more members, but India, which is concerned that the bloc could become a mouthpiece for its neighbor, and Brazil have advocated a cautious approach.
BRICS Agrees Rules Clearing Path for More Members (Aug. 23, 6:09 p.m.)
BRICS leaders edged closer to adding new members to their club for the first time since 2010, after agreeing terms for an enlargement of the group that they hope will lift its clout on the world stage.
“We have a document, which we have adopted, that sets out guidelines and principles, processes for considering countries that wish to become members of BRICS,” South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor told Ubuntu Radio. “The more detailed announcement will be made by the BRICS leaders” before the conclusion of their annual summit in Johannesburg, which ends Thursday, she said
India Backs Expansion, Calls For Space Consortium (Aug. 23, 3:58 p.m.)
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave public backing to adding new members to BRICS and Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the process to be accelerated.
“India fully supports the expansion of BRICS membership and we welcome moving forward on this based on consensus,” Modi said. He also suggested the creation of a BRICS space consortium.
BRICS Bank Aims to Hike Local-Currency Borrowing (Aug. 23, 3:45 p.m.)
New Development Bank, the multilateral lender founded by BRICS, aims to increase the share of funding it raises in local currencies to 30% from less than 20%, Leslie Maasdorp, its chief financial officer, told Bloomberg.
He also said it is struggling to find viable projects to fund as part of its $3 billion pledge for South Africa’s Just Energy Transition initiative, noting that “we need bankable projects that have gone through due diligence processes, and there’s a shortage.”
China to Set up BRICS Science Park, Xi Says (Aug. 23, 12:42 p.m.)
China will set up a science and innovation incubation park for BRICS nations, Xi said in a speech to the summit. He also said the bloc’s members had agreed on quick action to start artificial intelligence study group and expand their cooperation in the field.

The move to “comprehensively” pause purchases of aquatic products from Japan goes into effect Thursday, the Chinese customs office said in a statement, effectively making good on warnings this week to take “necessary steps” to safeguard food safety and the marine environment.
China is the largest single export market for Japanese exports of fish, crustaceans and aquatic invertebrates, with Japanese companies exporting almost 72 billion yen ($496 million) worth to China last year. Beijing has been the most vocal critic of Japan’s plan, which Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has insisted will meet safety standards.
Japan has also stressed that similar releases of wastewater are relatively commonplace. A two-year review by the International Atomic Energy Agency found Japan’s strategy would have a negligible impact on people and the environment.
Even so, China has blasted the release as “selfish and irresponsible.” The customs authority said the suspension of imports was intended to prevent radioactive contamination risks.

Earlier on Thursday, China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment said it would step up radiation monitoring in the nation’s sea areas and watch for any impact from the release.
China already bans food imports from 10 prefectures around the Fukushima plant. The Hong Kong government this week announced a ban on seafood imports from those same prefectures, four of which are landlocked.
Chinese seafood stocks rallied after the announcement from the Chinese customs authority.
Apart from Japan, China also buys seafood from other countries including Ecuador, Russia and Canada.
The process to release the treated wastewater — equivalent in volume to about 500 Olympic-size swimming pools — from the Fukushima site will take place over a period of at least 30 years.

Benchmark futures collapsed as much as 21%, the most since March 2022, on Thursday. Gas prices have been extremely volatile this month as traders await the outcome of threats of industrial action that could impact a tenth of global LNG supplies, at one point surging as much as 40% in response to the risks.
Unions representing workers at Woodside Energy Group Ltd’s North West Shelf LNG operations are considering a “strong offer” from the company after negotiations that ran through Wednesday night. Details of the settlement will be released after a meeting with members on Thursday, the Offshore Alliance — a group that represents two major unions, said.
Europe, still recovering from the worst of the energy crisis that pushed prices to records last year, has been highly reactive to supply disruption risks. Even with ample stocks, the region needs a continuous flow of LNG from global markets. Any prolonged shutdown of Australian facilities, which supply Asia, could risk shifting US or Qatari LNG away from European markets.
With inventories full well before the start of the heating season and industrial demand subdued, Europe for now remains well supplied.
“We will need to see what the unions finally decide at their meeting today, but all indications at the moment look promising that strike action at the North West Shelf will be avoided,” ING Groep NV said in a note on Thursday.
Even if a deal is agreed with Woodside, talks with Chevron Corp. on disputes with workers at two of its Australian LNG facilities are still ongoing. That puts 24.5 million tons of annual capacity is at risk, or about 5% of global liquefaction capacity.
Dutch front-month futures, Europe’s gas benchmark, were trading 17% lower at €30.48 a megawatt-hour at 8:20 a.m. in Amsterdam.

“The GAM Board recognises the importance of GAM shareholders determining a change in the GAM Board composition and looks forward to receiving the NewGAMe proposals for a future Extraordinary General Meeting,” the firm said in a statement on Thursday.
The offer from NewGAMe opens a fresh chapter in a tumultuous period for the Swiss asset manager that began five years ago and involved the shuttering of nine funds and the dismissal of star bond trader Tim Haywood.
Only 33.64% of GAM shareholders accepted Liontrust’s offer, meaning the firm will have to walk away. Shareholders originally had until July 25 to tender their shares to Liontrust, but the London-based asset manager announced three consecutive extensions as it tried to drum up enough support.
In May, GAM’s board agreed to Liontrust’s all-share offer worth 107 million Swiss francs ($122 million), which would have created a $66 billion global asset manager.
GAM’s decision to accept Liontrust’s bid drew immediate opposition from some of its investors. NewGAMe, which has been the most vocal opponent, said Liontrust’s bid undervalued the company. The group also made its own partial offer for GAM, as well as bridge financing to replace loans made by Liontrust of about 20 million Swiss francs in the event the latter’s tender offer for the firm is unsuccessful. NewGAMe’s offer is expected to conclude on Sept 28.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Liontrust said it currently expects to declare the offer unsuccessful. The bid would lead to a one-off exceptional charge of not more than £11 million ($14 million), Liontrust said.
“Liontrust made a full and fair offer for GAM, which reflected the financial reality of the business and would have provided a certain and sustainable solution,” Chief Executive Officer John Ions said in the statement.

Food delivery behemoth Meituan’s stock surged as much as 7.8% to be the biggest contributor to the advance on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which climbed nearly 3%. The company’s results due later Thursday are expected to show sales surged 32% in the second quarter.
Baidu Inc.’s shares climbed 6%, extending their rally after the company earlier this week reported sales that rose the most in more than a year. The search-engine operator joined China’s largest internet firms such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in rediscovering growth.
The gains are coming “on the back of solid earnings from Chinese companies lately,” said Redmond Wong, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets.
The Hang Seng Tech Index jumped as much as 4.2%. The rally came on the heels of a stellar set of results from Nvidia Corp., the standard bearer of the artificial intelligence theme, which sparked gains in technology shares across Asia. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of onshore Chinese stocks, rose more than 1%.
GQG Partners Emerging Markets Equity Fund, one of the world’s biggest fund investing in developing-nation stocks, is slowly rebuilding its exposure to Chinese internet firms, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.
“We are seeing growth coming back in terms of the quarterly results, and the crackdown is likely coming towards an end, like we saw some high-profile announcements made about the importance of the Internet platform sector,” Sudarshan Murthy, one of the fund’s portfolio managers, said in an interview. “We are slightly more optimistic on China than we were three months ago.”

Authorities briefly allowed ships traveling south to pass through the narrow waterway until 3 a.m. local time on Thursday, but the strait will remain closed to vessel traffic for the rest of the day, according to the Coastal Safety Directorate.
Turkey closed the Dardanelles to ships on Wednesday to clear the area for some 38 planes and helicopters fighting nearby forest fires.
About 250 vessels were waiting to cross the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits as of Thursday morning, according to Mustafa Can, chairman of Istanbul-based maritime transport company Transbosphor.
Black Sea freight rates have already moved up by about 10%, Can said by phone. “Two-way traffic should be allowed at night to decrease the number of waiting ships,” he said.

HONG KONG, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Asian shares rallied on Thursday after blockbuster results from tech darling Nvidia boosted Wall Street and a retreat in U.S. bond yields eased pressure on borrowing costs globally.
A round of soft manufacturing surveys had also revived hopes central banks were done tightening, though that might change depending on what clues about interest rates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives at an annual central bank summit in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.
""Equities rallied and bond yields retreated as flash PMI data for August signalled weaker economic activity in the U.S., euro area and UK, fuelling market expectations that central banks may not have to raise rates again,"" said analysts at ANZ in a note.
""This week's Jackson Hole Symposium remains firmly in focus for markets ... We expect (Powell) will err on the side of caution with respect to inflation, noting some signs of improvement but still with a long way to go.""
European markets were set for a higher open, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 1.7%, German DAX futures rising 0.6% and FTSE futures adding 0.5%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.7%, also lifted by Nvidia's bullish outlook.
The index is however down 8.1% so far this month due to the weakness in China's economy and yuan, as well as some gloomy factory readings from Japan, which also left sentiment fragile.
U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, rose 0.77%.
Australian shares edged up 0.63%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.81%, in a fourth straight session of gains on Thursday, the longest streak since mid-June.
China stocks also rebounded on Thursday with blue-chip CSI300 index advancing 1.28% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index up 2.1% in afternoon trade as some investors bought the dip following recent slumps.
The yuan inched higher against the dollar, as the central bank continued to fix the daily mid-point at stronger-than-expected levels.
""With the Chinese currency edging higher today, foreign capital has flowed back into and helped stabilise China's stock markets,"" Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset Management. ""A rally in the broader Asian markets following Nvidia's forecast has also lifted sentiment.""
Foreign investors bought a net 2.9 billion yuan ($398.78 million) of Chinese shares so far in the day, snapping a 13-day selling streak.
On Wednesday, U.S. stocks ended sharply higher across the board as shares of Nvidia jumped nearly 10% in trading after the bell, hitting an all-time high after it forecast third-quarter revenue well above Wall Street targets.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.54%, the S&P 500 gained 1.10% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.59%.
In U.S. Treasuries, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes reached 4.2076% compared with its U.S. close of 4.198% on Wednesday when it eased from near 16-year highs after weak business activity data from the United States and the euro zone.
The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 4.9885% compared with a U.S. close of 4.952%.
In currency markets, the dollar index stayed flat at 103.35 in afternoon Asia trade after hitting a two-month high of 103.4 against a basket of major currencies.
The yen recovered to 145.165 after hitting a nine-month trough of 145.34 amid talk from a former Bank of Japan official that Japan will only intervene in the market if the currency plunges past 150 to the dollar.
U.S. crude dipped 0.06% to $78.84 a barrel. Brent crude fell to $83.2 per barrel.
Gold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1,919.5 per ounce.

The city-state — which boosted the size from an earlier target of at least S$1.8 billion — plans to raise as much as S$2.75 billion via a placement to institutions and S$50 million through a public offering, according to details on the website of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS, which is acting as a government agent in the sale. The initial pricing guidance for the deal was around 3.15%.
The offering underscores a rush by borrowers to finance projects that will provide environmental benefits and support sustainable development. Singapore joins Hong Kong and countries such as Germany and Italy in selling green bonds this year, pushing global issuance of the environmentally-friendly notes by sovereigns and companies to over $344 billion so far in 2023, up 18% from year earlier, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
Singapore’s planned offering will be for at least S$2.3 billion and is part of an effort, announced last year, to raise as much as S$35 billion of environment-focused financing by 2030. Proceeds from the deal will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including the development of two routes on its electric rail network, according to a statement on the MAS website on Aug. 21.
MAS hired Citigroup Inc., DBS Bank Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Plc and United Overseas Bank Ltd. for the placement to institutions, while DBS, OCBC and UOB are participating banks for the public offering.
The note maturing in August 2072 traded above par at about 101 Singapore cents as of 2:11 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from nearly 125 cents in May but still higher than when priced at 98.976 cents.

Meloni’s administration is seeking to finalize a new framework that would allow individuals and small corporate borrowers to repay debts that went sour in previous years for a fraction of their nominal value, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named before the plan is approved.
But the new law could further upset lenders and international investors in a country still reeling from a surprise windfall tax on banks. Investor concerns are focused on the possibility that the measures could wipe out their returns and jeopardize Italy’s market for non-performing loans.
“Our aim is to lift as many people and firms as possible out of their bad loans, to settle old debts and get them back to work,” Industry Minister Adolfo Urso told Bloomberg News.
The proposal was originally laid out late last year by lawmakers close to Meloni and it’s been championed by Urso. Opposition lawmakers have presented a separate bill on the matter. While the parliament is set to start discussing the measures next month, the government could decide to accelerate the approval including the bill in one of its next decrees, the people said.
As was the case with the bank windfall tax approved earlier this month, Meloni’s lawmakers are seeking to curb excess profits pocketed by financial players, according to the text of the draft law. Investors in non-performing loans, often international, bought these debts in dramatic circumstances and “speculate over the twin weaknesses” of banks and borrowers making “loan-shark-like margins” which are “frankly unacceptable,” according to the draft.
Buyback Rules
Investors typically buy the loans in portfolios or bundle them into securitizations — often with a state guarantee — for a fraction of their nominal value. Soured unsecured loans, such as credit card loans, change hands for less than 10% of face value, while real estate debts and other debts backed by assets can fetch higher prices.
The new law would allow Italian borrowers with debts of less than €25 million ($27 million) that went sour between 2015 and 2021 to buy them back from funds that had purchased them from domestic lenders before the end of last year. Debtors would pay a 20% premium to the transaction price, according to the proposal presented by Meloni’s party and first reported by Italian media, including daily la Repubblica.
“The proposed bill caps the maximum recovery on the best credits, while the loans where recoveries are low remain unchanged — this impacts the rationale for their investments,” said Gregorio Consoli, a Milan-based managing partner for finance at law firm Chiomenti.
“As long as there’s uncertainty over the rules, funds will likely stop investing, banks would find it harder to sell their bad loans and this may have an impact on their ability to grant new loans,” Consoli said.
The measure would be a fresh blow for the Italian non-performing loan market which has attracted scores of international buyers since 2015. International funds have spent billions of euros to purchase bad loans held by Italian banks over the last eight years, allowing them to exit hard-to-recover positions while spurring new lending activity.
Disposals helped cut Italian lenders’ non-performing exposure from €341 billion at the end of 2015 to €58 billion in March of this year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers reports.
The law could also have an impact on the guarantees provided by the state to help banks offload about €110 billion of debts. Under the so-called GACS program, banks are able to bundle their bad loans into securities for sale, while purchasing a state guarantee for the least-risky portions in order to make them more appealing to investors.
“In its current form, it’s inevitable that the law would weigh on GACS, although it’s hard to quantify the impact,” Consoli said.

The results, reported late on Wednesday, were driven by an artificial intelligence (AI) boom-fueled demand for its chips, and will boost its position in the prized trillion-dollar market value club it entered earlier this year.
More than 20 brokerages raised their target price for Nvidia post the earnings update, according to Refinitiv data, with Elazar Advisors being the most bullish at $1,600.
That represents an over three-fold rise from last close of $471.16.
Along with Rosenblatt Securities at $1,100 - they are the only ones to have targets above $1,000 for Nvidia. The chipmaker's median price target is $567.
Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI apps, virtually all of which are powered by its graphics processors.
Its shares have tripled in value this year, adding more than $700 billion to its market valuation and making it the first trillion-dollar chip firm.
""Everyone has been looking for ways to play AI that aren't as expensive as Nvidia given the run this year. However, in our opinion NVDA itself remains the best way to accomplish that,"" said Bernstein analysts led by Stacy A. Rasgon.
""Given the magnitude of earnings revisions, we suspect the stock will still come out cheaper than it was going into the print.""
The results are also seen keeping a Wall Street rally alive, with futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumping more than 1%, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.7%.
""Nvidia news has a boosting effect on technology stocks, if only by confirming that all the talk around the AI-craze was not empty, after all,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.
A lot rested on Nvidia posting strong results, as most of the S&P 500's over 15% year-to-date gains have come from the AI-driven rally in Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks.
Analysts had warned that if the results beat wasn't big enough, that could trip the rally as investors would question lofty valuations on tech stock in the backdrop of rising yields. [US/]
Elsewhere, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which supplies to Nvidia, rose 2.2%.
European chip companies also rose, with ASM International, BE Semiconductor and Aixtron gaining nearly 2% each. Europe's tech index was up 1.1%, among the top gainers in the regions. (This story has been refiled to correct the spelling of 'Nvidia' in paragraph 14 and 'Bernstein' in paragraph 8)

The Houston-based oil company obtained full control of the Surmont field in Alberta, Canada, this year, paid for with funds from three US dollar bond sales worth $2.7 billion.
Aegon NV of the Netherlands, which oversees more than $300 billion, says ConocoPhillips might now be in breach of its tar sands policy and may be added to its exclusion list later this year. KLP, Norway’s biggest pension fund with about $90 billion in assets, says it’s also monitoring the oil producer after the Surmont deal.
The acquisition will likely push Conoco’s revenue from oil sands, which can emit three times more greenhouse gases than conventional crude oil, to roughly 6.9% of next year’s total, up from 3.6% in 2021, according to an analysis by the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute. That’s a red line for some investors, with ESG funds in particular setting a 5% limit on the revenue that can come from oil sands.
KLP has “a clear position against investments in oil sands,” which its fund managers “enforce” when revenue exceeds the 5% figure, Arild Skedsmo, a senior analyst for responsible investments at KLP, told Bloomberg. If Conoco “crosses the threshold, they will be excluded from our portfolio,” he said. And in light of the latest developments, “this is a company that we will follow closely.”
Aegon’s assessment is that the Surmont deal means Conoco “could be added to our exclusion list,” Veronique Lefel, a spokeswoman for Aegon, said by email. Aegon wasn’t immediately able to provide an estimate of its holdings in the oil company.
A Conoco spokesperson declined to comment.
KLP, which holds about $35 million worth of Conoco shares, voted against the company’s board at this year’s annual general meeting. Skedsmo said KLP is concerned that Conoco doesn’t have “credible” policies mapping out how it will transition away from fossil fuels. And building out investments in oil sands is “unlikely to improve their position,” he said.
It’s an opening salvo in what’s likely to be a wave of funds with green mandates that are now looking to exit Conoco, according to the Anthroprocene Fixed Income Institute, which monitors debt markets for environmental, social and governance controversies. In all, there are close to 600 ESG funds with investments in Conoco, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The irony is that some of those same ESG investors helped finance Conoco’s Surmont acquisition, the AFII said. They include BlackRock Inc., which is among providers of ESG-labeled exchange-traded funds that apply the 5% oil-sands exclusion threshold in accordance with MSCI Inc. methodology.
“The completion of this acquisition will likely take ConocoPhillips in-scope of exclusion, but the fallacy of passive index construction means that ESG ETFs are compelled to buy the bond in the interim,” said AFII researchers including Josephine Richardson, the group’s head of portfolio strategy. It’s a “paradox of investors funding deals which produce companies which are uninvestible.”
A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment.
It’s not yet clear how Conoco’s planned expansion of its oil-sands business will affect its ESG scores. The company is rated AA by MSCI ESG Research, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
MSCI said in a statement that it “can’t comment on potential future changes in company assessments. We won’t be in a position to confirm whether the 5% threshold for revenue from oil sands, as set out in the MSCI ESG Screened Indexes methodology, has been breached until the relevant information becomes public in due course.”
Conoco exercised its right to acquire TotalEnergies SE’s 50% stake in the Surmont field in May. That thwarted efforts by Suncor Energy Inc., one of the largest players in Canada’s oil sands, to buy into the site. Suncor has an MSCI ESG rating of A.
Some European investors have already blacklisted ConocoPhillips because of its oil-sands business. Danske Bank Asset Management, which looks after more than $100 billion, excluded the company for that reason in 2021, according to Oshni Arachchi, the firm’s head of active ownership.
Oil-sands production at the Surmont field relies on steam being injected into underground wells to force the region’s heavy bitumen to the surface. It’s the fourth-largest such site in Canada.
Information on bondholders is hard to trace due to delays in fund disclosures. Richardson says the situation presents an opportunity for active sustainable investors to beat rigid passive strategies.
“Any exclusion criteria is inherently a passive investment strategy,” Richardson said. Active managers “can choose to anticipate and incorporate these factors earlier in the investment process,” she said.

Bank Indonesia Thursday kept the benchmark seven-day reverse repurchase rate at a four-year high of 5.75%. While the decision was widely expected, Governor Perry Warjiyo announced a new tool to attract foreign funds to support the local currency.
The decision came as data compiled by Bloomberg showed investors sold $127 million worth of Indonesian bonds so far this August. The rupiah held its earlier 0.3% gain against the greenback to trade at 15,245 per dollar after the announcement.
The policy focus is oriented toward strengthening rupiah stability to mitigate the contagion effect of global financial market uncertainty, Warjiyo told reporters at the policy briefing.
Warjiyo had previously maintained that the central bank can sufficiently anchor the rupiah through its “Operation Twist” bond market interventions, propping up short-term yields to lure inflows. With funds outflows this month showing that the strategy wasn’t entirely paying off, the BI announced issuing ‘Bank Indonesia Rupiah Securities’ to attract foreign portfolio investment.
The securities, with tenors of 6-, 9- and 12-months, are the latest example of the central bank employing unconventional policy tools instead of relying too much on rates, which if tightened too much could be detrimental to the economy.
“BI clearly remains reluctant to adjust the policy rate either way despite the pressures on the currency, opting instead to introduce a new instrument to attract capital inflows rather than hiking,” said Brian Tan, an economist at Barclays Bank Plc.
The greenback has been strengthening against emerging-market currencies this month amid indications the Fed could keep rates higher for longer as the US looks likely to avoid a recession. The rupiah has weakened over 1% so far this August, though it has clawed back some gains in the last three days.
Adding to the currency pressure is a global commodity slump that’s fast eroding Indonesia’s trade surplus. The current account swung back to a $1.9-billion deficit in the second quarter. Foreign reserves remain adequate, though the take-up of a Bank Indonesia facility to attract dollar export earnings remains tepid.
While the specter of rate hikes has reappeared among analysts, Bank Indonesia remains wary of tightening further due to fears economic growth could slow in the second half of 2023. Bank lending, retail sales and consumer confidence are softening. Inflation has also long returned to the central bank’s 2%-4% target, with the BI expecting consumer price gains to average 2.9% this year.
Warjiyo Thursday said that the global outlook remains uncertain, with a weaker recovery in China seen influencing the world economy. Still, BI retained its 4.5%-5.3% growth view for Indonesia’s economy in 2023.
Credit demand grew 8.54% in July, Warjiyo said, adding that the BI expects loan requirement increasing in line with the domestic economy’s strong performance. The bank earlier announced allowing banks to, starting October, cut their reserve requirement ratio by nearly half when they lend to priority sectors.

Shares rose 8.7% to $512 before markets in New York opened on Thursday after Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October. If the gain holds, it will mark a record. Analysts had estimated just $12.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia’s results last quarter also blew past projections, and it approved an additional $25 billion in stock buybacks.
The outlook underscores Nvidia’s role as the key beneficiary of the AI computing boom. Faced with skyrocketing demand for chatbots and other tools, data center operators are stocking up on the company’s processors, which are adept at handling the heavy workloads required by artificial intelligence. That’s helped Nvidia quickly pull out of an global chip slump and accelerate sales growth to its fastest rate in years.
“A new computing era has begun,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement. Companies around the world are shifting to more powerful computing that can handle ChatGPT-style generative AI, he said.
The gains add to a more than threefold increase for the stock this year. Shares closed at $471.16 in New York on Wednesday before Nvidia released its quarterly report.
In the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 30, revenue doubled to $13.5 billion, the company said. Profit was $2.70 a share, minus certain items. Analysts had predicted sales of about $11 billion and profit of $2.07.
Nvidia became the first-ever semiconductor company to rack up a $1 trillion market valuation after another blowout quarter in May. It has emerged as the main supplier of infrastructure needed to support the growing use of AI systems. But investors have been waiting for more evidence that the second quarter was the beginning of a long-term expansion and not a one-time spike. What they got Wednesday was even more bullish than hoped.
Underscoring Nvidia’s dramatic growth, this quarter’s revenue target is 28% above Wall Street projections and nearly as high as the company’s total annual sales in 2021.
In another milestone, Nvidia’s quarterly sales overtook those of Intel Corp. for the first time. Though Nvidia has had a higher valuation than Intel since 2020, posting more revenue than the chip pioneer shows just how pervasive its products have become.
Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Huang, who still runs the company. He’s successfully parlayed a business making graphics chips for video games into dominance of the market for so-called accelerators — chips that help train AI software by bombarding it with data. Nvidia’s rapid introduction of ever-more powerful processors — along with accompanying software — has left would-be rivals trailing far behind. Customers such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s. Google, meanwhile, are lining up to take as many chips as Nvidia can supply.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“A significant 2Q beat and raise, a repeat of 1Q’s performance, suggests sustained demand strength in Nvidia’s Data Center (DC) business, while guidance 29% above consensus for 3Q implies the company may get its hands on better-than-expected supply. Gross-margin upside (112 bps above consensus) is likely to continue as the DC contribution rises.”
— Kunjan Sobhani, BI technology industry analyst

Like many of its peers, Nvidia doesn’t operate its own chip production and relies on outsourced manufacturing provided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. That arrangement frees it from the huge expenditure and risks of investing in manufacturing. But it also gives it less ability to adjust supply quickly.
There were concerns that supply constraints could hamper Nvidia’s sales in the current quarter, but its forecast suggests that operations are running smoothly. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company is happy with the progress it’s making in getting more components.
“We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year,” she told analysts on a conference call.
Nvidia’s division that supplies chips to data centers — once a sideline business — has become its biggest moneymaker. The unit had sales of $10.3 billion last quarter, versus an estimate of $7.98 billion. Gaming revenue was $2.49 billion, compared with an average analyst prediction of $2.38 billion. Automotive-related chips brought in $253 million.
The personal computer market, previously Nvidia’s largest source of revenue, had slumped in the past year. But it has returned to being a growth driver. Demand for laptop components is particularly strong, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.

AI has been the hottest topic for tech investors this year, and every major company has talked up its capabilities in that area. But Nvidia is one of the few making serious money from the trend, which has accelerated since the public debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. That tool helped show the potential of generative AI to a broader audience.
Nvidia’s stock run-up of more than 200% this year has eclipsed the gains of all others in the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.
The company’s gains are all the more remarkable because it can’t sell its full lineup to the largest chip market, China. The US government requires Nvidia to obtain licenses to supply Chinese customers with its best-performing AI-related chips.
The announcement of that rule last year put a dent in shipments to the Asian nation and forced Nvidia to rework one of its key products. The company depowered one of its graphics processor units, or GPUs, to make sure it didn’t trigger the China restriction. But the Biden administration is considering new regulations that could limit sales of that component as well, Bloomberg has reported.
Nvidia’s CFO Kress addressed that possibility Wednesday on the call.
“Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results,” she said.
Nvidia also has become more important as a tech industry bellwether. The chipmaker’s forecasts provide a window into the plans of some of the world’s most valuable companies — and indicate how much those businesses are willing to spend to overhaul computer systems to accommodate AI.

Sales rose 33% to 67.96 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) in the quarter ended June, against an average projection for 67.2 billion yuan, the company said in a statement Thursday. Net income rose
As with its peers in the internet industry, Meituan is seen as a barometer of China’s post-Covid recovery, which has proven weaker than expected. It’s shed more than 25% of its market value this year.
Still, the company has benefited as consumers grappling with a property slump shun big-ticket items to instead spend on experiences from trips and movies to dining. That’s propping up Meituan’s meals and travel services, and the company has splashed out on marketing to tap that post-pandemic demand.
The company’s longer-term prospects depend on how it navigates post-pandemic demand swings and new arenas such as AI. Meituan joined a global AI investment frenzy alongside big players like Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. when it doled out almost $234 million to buy co-founder Wang Huiwen’s generative AI startup. But Chief Executive Officer Wang Xing acknowledged this year it was “still playing catch-up” on that front.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Meituan’s 2Q core local commerce operating profit gain probably exceeded consensus estimates of a 17% year-over-year increase as margin of the firm’s in-store and travel-related unit jumped from Covid-impacted lows a year earlier. This would have been led by a surge in the unit’s revenue as more consumers in mainland China dined out and traveled within the country and overseas after the cessation of local Covid Zero measures. Such a rise in travel demand will likely persist through December and help lift Meituan’s overall margin this year.

While the days of heady growth for China’s tech giants are over, Beijing’s rhetorical support for private enterprise mark a significant step toward reversing a crackdown that erased hundreds of billions of market value from the sector since 2021. Meituan and its long-standing backer, Tencent, were both praised in a rare post from the nation’s powerful economic planner for making investments that aligned with Beijing’s goals.
For now, Meituan is expanding into adjacent areas from grocery retailing to group-buying. In March, the food delivery giant abandoned its ride-hailing service to cut down on costs. And it’s investing heavily in live-streaming services to fend off rivals like ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin.
As it looks beyond its home market, Meituan has also been rolling out cash-heavy incentive schemes for its “KeeTa” meal delivery app in Hong Kong, its first foray beyond the mainland Chinese market it dominates. Its debut in the city in May pits it against Deliveroo Plc and Delivery Hero SE’s Foodpanda in the international financial hub.

The company announced revenue of $13.51 billion in the second quarter, more than doubling the $6.7 billion it made last year and crushing market expectations. On top of that, it earned $6.18 billion in GAAP net income, nine times the $656 million it made in Q2 2022.
NVIDIA's gaming segment did pretty well too, thanks to $2.49 billion in Q2 revenue, up 22 percent from last year. During the quarter, it started shipping the budget-oriented GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, announced the Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) for games and saw the addition of 35 DLSS games including Diablo IV. (Earlier this week, it unveiled DLSS 3.5 designed to use AI to make ray-traced games look better.)
But it was very much the AI and data center segments that pushed NVIDIA to new heights. It saw a record $10.32 billion in revenue in that sector alone, up 141 percent from Q1 2023 and 171 percent from a year ago.
Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang said that back in 2018, NVIDIA had a ""bet the company"" moment when it started using AI to power DLSS, ""and while we were reinventing CG with AI, we were reinventing the GPU for AI."" He later added that ""the future is a large language model (LLM) at the front of just about everything,"" from VFX to heavy industry.
NVIDIA's prescience is now paying off with the company's flagship H100 Tensor Core GPU. It's also been building more complex systems like the HGX box, which puts eight H100 GPUs into a single computer. All of that helped it create immense cashflows with top customers spending heavily on NVIDIA GPU tech to build complex AI models — like Microsoft with its Azure segment.
In addition, the company's use of custom software and apps makes it difficult for customers to switch rivals like AMD. ""Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity which is also helping for gross margins,"" said NVIDIA finance chief Colette Kress in an analyst call.
All that led to a perfect storm of profit. ""During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI,"" Huang said in a statement. ""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI."" The company expects more to come, forecasting around $16 billion in revenue for Q3.",NVIDIA records mega profits thanks to its AI chip business,471.16,471.63,460.17999,8,2023,24

QQQ Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Forecast: Markets Wrap
Morningstar Inc. upgraded the chipmaker to hold after blowout results on Wednesday that showed booming demand for artificial intelligence computing.
The research firm is “much more optimistic about the rise of AI workloads and how Nvidia’s wide moat should cement itself as an AI chip leader,” analyst Brian Colello wrote in a note.
Nvidia now has 54 buy ratings and five holds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock rallied as much as 8.8% in premarket trading on Thursday, on track for a new all-time high. It has more than tripled this year, pushing the company’s market valuation above $1 trillion.
Morningstar determines its ratings based on the current share price, the analyst’s estimate of the stock’s “fair value” and an “uncertainty rating” of that valuation. Nvidia’s fair value was lifted to $480 per share from $300, while its uncertainty rating was raised to “very high.”
Nvidia’s data center business, including AI graphics processors, is expected to generate $41 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending January 2024, compared with $15 billion a year earlier, according to Morningstar. The chipmaker reported data center revenue of $10 billion in the quarter ended July 31.
“We could be wrong, but we see little evidence that these GPU orders are upfront spending or a one-time build,” Colello wrote, estimating sales for the business could reach $60 billion next year and $100 billion in fiscal 2028. “Such growth might be unprecedented in large-cap tech, but we foresee all types of enterprises investing in AI,” he added.

One jubilant analyst made a bold call: He thinks Nvidia will be the ""most important company to civilization"" in the next decade.
Wall Street darling Nvidia had another blowout quarter thanks to robust demand for its artificial intelligence, or AI, chips, sending its share price surging.
The chipmaker posted record second-quarter revenue of $13.51 billion — 88% higher than the previous quarter and up 101% from a year ago.
Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at CFRA, told Yahoo Finance Live Nvidia will be the ""most important company to civilization"" over the next five to 10 years because every enterprise company will be reliant on the chipmaker directly or indirectly.
Even Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, gushed in a tweet: ""It's all about AI demand and use cases. The rest of tech will see this unprecedented spending wave not seen since 1995 over the coming years but Nvidia is on the front lines and the best barometer of true spending. This is NOT hype, it's jaw dropping spending happening NOW.""
The bumper results excited investors so much that they sent Nvidia's stock up 3.2% to close at $471.16 apiece on Thursday. The shares extended gains by 6.6% in after-hours trade and are up 222% this year.
Nvidia's stock surge also boosted the wealth of company co-founder Jensen Huang, who has seen his fortune soar by 200% to $42 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This makes Huang the 29th richest person in the world.
And there may be further opportunities for Nvidia in the AI space, according to one analyst.
""We are still in the very early innings of a multidecade computational transformation,"" wrote Tejas Dessai, a research analyst at Global X, in a Wednesday note seen by Insider. ""AI needs specialized chips to run on, and trillions worth of processing chips will be up for replacement through this decade.""
Dessai added there are other opportunities for AI chips as they eventually make their way into other products including smartphones, laptops, cars, and medical devices.

NVDA,2023-08-24 13:45:40,The Nasdaq popped after Nvidia's earnings smashed Wall Street's expectations.,"Nvidia pops after another earnings beat
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were up more than 3% after the company's second quarter earnings smashed expectations.
Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:
The company reported revenue of $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year, while adjusted earnings came in at $2.70 per share, up 429% from last year. Analysts had expected revenue to come in at $11.04 billion with earnings per share totaled $2.07, according to data from Bloomberg.
Nvidia also issued current quarter revenue guidance of $16 billion, plus or minus 2%, far outpacing Wall Street's already lofty expectations for $12.5 billion in revenue.
Nvidia's report had been seen as a key test for the ongoing AI hype cycle, which has pushed companies of all stripes to dive into the technology in hopes of cashing in on the mania. But none has seen the actual fortunes of their business change to extent already being enjoyed by Nvidia.
""A new computing era has begun,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.""
By segment, Nvidia reported data center revenue of $10.3 billion and gaming revenues of $2.5 billion, topping forecasts for $8 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. The company also announced a new $25 billion share repurchase plan and said it intends to buy back stock during its current fiscal year.
Nasdaq futures higher after Nvidia does it again
For the second quarter in a row, Nvidia confirmed the view of many investors that AI truly is the next game changer for the tech industry.
And bolstered the market along with it.
Nivida stock was up as much as 8% pre-market after another blowout quarter with guidance rising significantly on current-quarter demand for its chips with AI driving the train. Nasdaq futures were up about 0.9% in response.
Dow futures, however, were off about 0.2% early Thursday while S&P 500 were up a bit less than 0.9%.

Yet betting against the US-listed automaker is a risky endeavor.
Just 1% of VinFast’s shares are available for trading, making the stock illiquid and expensive for short sellers to borrow. The tiny free float also makes VinFast vulnerable to unpredictable swings of the sort that added more than $80 billion to its value this week — a jump that helped it overtake General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in size, combined.
That’s keeping short sellers wary even though VinFast’s surge looks out of step with the fundamentals of a company that’s been dogged by poor product reviews and operational problems. While other thinly traded companies that gained US listings via so-called SPAC mergers have eventually given up gains, timing any turn is notoriously difficult.
Shares spiked as much as 53% Thursday, as of 9:59 a.m. New York time, rallying to trade as high as $56.75 with a market valuation above $120 billion.
“Shorting the stock may look logical at first glance but we think at this point, it is not the best trading strategy,” said Maybank analyst Tyler Manh Dung Nguyen.
A VinFast spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on market moves.
Regulatory filings show Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam’s richest man, directly and indirectly controls 99% of the company’s outstanding shares, mostly through his conglomerate, Vingroup JSC. Vuong is Vietnam’s richest person with a total net worth of $43.4 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
VinFast went public via a special-purpose acquisition company merger this year with blank-check company Black Spade Acquisition Co., founded by casino mogul Lawrence Ho.
Short sellers bold enough to bet against the company have racked up nearly $1 million in paper losses since the deal closed, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
The minuscule float and the lack of large institutional investors that participate in traditional lending programs means the supply for would-be short sellers is “very scarce,” according to Matthew Unterman, a director at S3 Partners. “Rates for any scraps of supply are trading in the triple digit fees,” which means shorts are willing to pay more than 100% interest per year to bet against the company.
For investors familiar with companies that merged with SPACs, VinFast’s volatility may not come as a surprise. As the vast majority of shareholders opt to exchange their stake for their money back — 92% of investors in the VinFast deal did just that — the pool of shares available for trading tends to shrink.

On paper, VinFast is now bigger than more than 400 of the companies in the S&P 500 Index after Thursday’s jump. Its valuation makes it larger than market staples such as Citigroup Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc.
VinFast, which began building a factory in North Carolina last month, forecasts sales will reach 45,000 to 50,000 this year and Vuong predicts it will break even by the end of 2024. In May, it recalled all the electric sport utility vehicles shipped to the US over a software malfunction and the company also cut some of its US workforce amid modest sales.
The company expects its revenue to reach $1.88 billion in 2023, according to a investor presentation in June, meaning it is trading at a multiple of more than 50-times sales. That’s far above valuations for peers like Lucid Group Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc.
“Professionals wouldn’t touch it with a bargepole,” said Oktay Kavrak, product strategist at Leverage Shares.

Nvidia Nears Record High as AI Demand Fuels Blowout Forecast
Though Nvidia didn’t give long-term projections Wednesday, Huang said that supply will “substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year.” The company relies on vendors such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. for components, and a lack of adequate inventory was seen as a challenge to its growth run.
In an interview Wednesday, Huang stressed that the company was doing everything it can to stay on top of surging demand.
“We’re focused on increasing our supply,” Huang said. “We have to do that with great urgency, and we are.”

Nvidia has a commanding lead in the market for artificial intelligence processors, which handle the heavy workloads needed to power tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its position has made it the world’s most valuable chipmaker — with a market capitalization above $1 trillion. The stock hit a record high on Thursday. And the shift to AI is only beginning, Huang said.
Accelerated computing, which speeds through specific tasks by breaking them up into smaller parts and working on them in parallel, is taking over, he argues.
“The big mega theme is that the world’s computer data centers are transitioning to a new model, from general purpose computing to accelerated computing,” he said. The Nvidia co-founder believes there’s a trillion dollars’ worth of data center infrastructure around the world that has to make this change. The company reported sales of $13.5 billion last quarter, more than double from a year earlier.
Such broad shifts happen rarely and bring huge opportunities for companies that have the right products to exploit them, Huang said.
“Every 15 years, you see a new platform shift,” he said. “It’s happening right now in real time.”

BRICS Bloc Grows Heft With Saudi Arabia and Other Mideast Powers
More People Call in Sick on August 24 Than Any Other Day
Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and United Arab Emirates will become full members on Jan. 1, said South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa in a joint press conference of the BRICS leaders on Thursday at their annual summit in Johannesburg. The enlisting of new members was agreed by the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It will be the first expansion since 2010.
An expansion of the group of emerging market powers could help boost its global heft and counter the dominance of the Group of Seven. The enlargement will see BRICS gross domestic product rise to 36% of global GDP at purchasing power parity and 46% of the world’s population, said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
China and India Need to Sort Out Issues: Official (4:00 p.m.)
China and India need to sort out their differences, a Chinese official told a BRICS briefing, describing the two major Asian countries as trying to address their issues on border and trade.
“We are two countries with huge population and economic sizes, we have to have good terms, maybe not today but tomorrow — but we will do it in the long-term,” said Li Kexin, Director-General of the Department of International Economic Affairs at China’s Foreign Ministry.
BRICS to Have Two-Tiered Membership (1:51 p.m.)
BRICS plans to have a two-tired membership system, Anil Sooklal, South Africa’s ambassador to the bloc said in an interview. The group will have full members and partners, he said.
Saudi Arabia Cites Ability to Steady Energy Market (12:48 p.m.)
Saudi Arabia has “efficient tools and a responsible role to stabilize the energy market,” the kingdom’s Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said at the BRICS summit.
He told the audience that his nation looks forward to further developing economic and financial relations and emphasized cooperation to tackle common challenges.
UN Urges Renewal of Multilateralism at BRICS (12:06 p.m.)
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged BRICS leaders to restore faith in multilateralism and invoked the specter of the First World War for failing to do so.
“I have come to Johannesburg with a simple message: in a fracturing world with overwhelming crises, there is simply no alternative to cooperation,” he told the summit. “We cannot afford a world with a divided global economy and financial system; with diverging strategies on technology including artificial intelligence; and with conflicting security frameworks.”
Speaking before the heads of state of dozens of nations in the Global South, Guterres said developed countries must “finally keep their promises” to those that are still developing. “As a matter of justice, Africa must be considered a priority in all these efforts,” he said.
China’s Xi Praises “Historic” Expansion (10:10 a.m.)
Chinese President Xi Jinping said during the joint press conference of BRICS leaders that expansion of the group is historic and a new starting point for cooperation among developing nations that shows its determination to “unite and cooperate with” other developing nations.

In addition, the company reported $6.7 billion in net income in the quarter, a 422% increase over the same time last year.
Nvidia shares jumped and were up 8% in pre-market trading on Aug. 24, bringing them up an eye-popping 229% year-to-date.
Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note that this was “a historical moment for the broader tech sector and a sneak preview of what is on the horizon.”
“Very simply, Nvidia’s guidance and commentary was at ‘drop the mic’ level as investors now recognize crystal clear this AI demand story is as real as any tech trend we have seen in the last 30 years only comparable to the Internet in 1995 and Apple’s iPhone launch in 2007,” wrote Ives. “We view this as a table pounder time to own tech stocks as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th derivatives of AI now are set to play out.”
Nvidia also released optimistic guidance, with expected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $16 billion, according to the earnings report.
Where will it go from here?
Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College and author of the forthcoming book “Brain Rush: How To Invest and Compete in the $7 Trillion Generative AI Ecosystem,” said he would not be surprised to see Nvidia stock triple from here.
“It targets markets worth over $1 trillion and controls 80% of the AI GPU [graphic processing units] market,” said Cohan.
Cohan added that the company has a plethora of competitive advantages, including more than a decade of investment in collaboration with AI developers and partners, its ability to build chips that suit the emerging needs of customers and its software libraries that enhance developer productivity.
“This will keep competitors from taking market share from Nvidia. Until the industry slows down, Nvidia will enjoy expectations-beating growth to propel its stock,” he added.
Other experts nuanced the sentiment, however, saying that while the company “is a machine because it dominates a sector in very high demand, the risk is that the hyper-growth may not continue beyond a few more quarters.”
Phil Siegel, founder of CAPTRS, explained that this could happen for several reasons, including the fact that others such as AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) are launching competitive products that will potentially pressure margins in 2025.
“All that being said, it’s not a ridiculous price for the stock even after hours trading,” Siegel added.

Is the stock overvalued?
Meanwhile, some analysts said that the stock is overvalued and investors should take a look at smaller names.
For instance, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “the days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging. Find out where we see potential growth opportunities built on AI.”
Ives, on the other hand, wrote in his note that while this bearish sentiment is not surprising, as in the past 23 years “valuation centric bears” have missed every major transformational tech name, such as Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Netflix.
“Nvidia, among others and this trend/theme will be no different. Is Lebron just a basketball player? Messi just a futbol/soccer player, Djokovic just a tennis player?, Tiger just a golfer? Mahomes just a football player? Caitlin Clark just a college basketball player?…they are special, generational talents, and different and so is this AI tech theme in our opinion,” he wrote.

The decision Thursday by the US Court of Appeals in Manhattan came in a securities fraud lawsuit brought by a trustee for note purchasers in a 2014 syndicated loan deal led by JPMorgan. Soon after the notes began trading, the borrower, drug-testing company Millennium Health ran into legal troubles and filed for bankruptcy the next year.
The trustee, Marc Kirschner, declined to comment on the decision.
Loan notes are not currently considered securities, so a ruling against JPMorgan would have had sweeping ramifications for regulation of the leveraged loan market. A lower court had previously dismissed Kirschner’s fraud claims on the grounds that notes were not securities.
“The District Court did not erroneously dismiss plaintiff’s state-law securities claims because plaintiff failed to plausibly suggest that the notes are securities,” Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes wrote on behalf of the three-judge appellate panel.
The Securities and Exchange Commission declined in July to share its view on whether leveraged loans are securities, a development widely seen as making it less likely that the court would overturn the status quo.
The case had drawn heavy attention from the finance industry, including private equity firms. A trade group for banks involved in the loans, the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, lobbied the SEC heavily while the regulator deliberated on the court’s request to provide feedback. holding over 10 meetings with SEC staff and three of its five commissioners.
Kirschner said JPMorgan and the other banks withheld key information that would have tipped off investors about trouble at Millennium. The company in May 2015 announced it had reached a $246 million settlement with the Justice Department and other parties over billing fraud allegations.
The case is Kirschner v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 21-2726, Second US Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan).

AMC completed a reverse stock split Thursday, ahead of a planned conversion of preferred equity units into common shares. The reverse split gave shareholders in the movie-theater chain one share for every 10 they previously held, and has the effect of increasing AMC's share price. The conversion of AMC's preferred ""Ape"" units and reduction of shares outstanding will allow AMC to sell a substantial amount of new shares as it attempts to shore up its balance sheet.

Nvidia Nears Record High as AI Demand Fuels Blowout Forecast
The shares rose 1.9% to $480.01 in New York after Nvidia said sales will be about $16 billion in the three months ending in October. Analysts had estimated just $12.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia’s results last quarter also blew past projections, and it approved an additional $25 billion in stock buybacks.
The outlook underscores Nvidia’s role as the key beneficiary of the AI computing boom. Faced with skyrocketing demand for chatbots and other tools, data center operators are stocking up on the company’s processors, which are adept at handling the heavy workloads required by artificial intelligence. That’s helped Nvidia quickly pull out of an global chip slump and accelerate sales growth to its fastest rate in years.
“A new computing era has begun,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement. Companies around the world are shifting to more powerful computing that can handle ChatGPT-style generative AI, he said.
The stock had climbed as much as 6.7% earlier in Thursday’s session, before paring gains as part of a broader pullback. That added to a more than threefold increase for the stock this year. The shares closed at $471.16 in New York on Wednesday before Nvidia released its quarterly report.
In the fiscal second quarter, which ended July 30, revenue doubled to $13.5 billion, the company said. Profit was $2.70 a share, minus certain items. Analysts had predicted sales of about $11 billion and profit of $2.07.
Nvidia became the first-ever semiconductor company to rack up a $1 trillion market valuation after another blowout quarter in May. It has emerged as the main supplier of infrastructure needed to support the growing use of AI systems. But investors have been waiting for more evidence that the second quarter was the beginning of a long-term expansion and not a one-time spike. What they got Wednesday was even more bullish than hoped.
Underscoring Nvidia’s dramatic growth, this quarter’s revenue target is 28% above Wall Street projections and nearly as high as the company’s total annual sales in 2021.
In another milestone, Nvidia’s quarterly sales overtook those of Intel Corp. for the first time. Though Nvidia has had a higher valuation than Intel since 2020, posting more revenue than the chip pioneer shows just how pervasive its products have become.
Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Huang, who still runs the company. He’s successfully parlayed a business making graphics chips for video games into dominance of the market for so-called accelerators — chips that help train AI software by bombarding it with data. Nvidia’s rapid introduction of ever-more powerful processors — along with accompanying software — has left would-be rivals trailing far behind. Customers such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s. Google, meanwhile, are lining up to take as many chips as Nvidia can supply.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
“A significant 2Q beat and raise, a repeat of 1Q’s performance, suggests sustained demand strength in Nvidia’s Data Center (DC) business, while guidance 29% above consensus for 3Q implies the company may get its hands on better-than-expected supply. Gross-margin upside (112 bps above consensus) is likely to continue as the DC contribution rises.”
— Kunjan Sobhani, BI technology industry analyst

Like many of its peers, Nvidia doesn’t operate its own chip production and relies on outsourced manufacturing provided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. That arrangement frees it from the huge expenditure and risks of investing in manufacturing. But it also gives it less ability to adjust supply quickly.
There were concerns that supply constraints could hamper Nvidia’s sales in the current quarter, but its forecast suggests that operations are running smoothly. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company is happy with the progress it’s making in getting more components.
“We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year,” she told analysts on a conference call.
Nvidia’s division that supplies chips to data centers — once a sideline business — has become its biggest moneymaker. The unit had sales of $10.3 billion last quarter, versus an estimate of $7.98 billion. Gaming revenue was $2.49 billion, compared with an average analyst prediction of $2.38 billion. Automotive-related chips brought in $253 million.
The personal computer market, previously Nvidia’s largest source of revenue, had slumped in the past year. But it has returned to being a growth driver. Demand for laptop components is particularly strong, the Santa Clara, California-based company said.
Read More: Nvidia CEO Dispels Fears About Running Out of Chips in AI Boom
AI has been the hottest topic for tech investors this year, and every major company has talked up its capabilities in that area. But Nvidia is one of the few making serious money from the trend, which has accelerated since the public debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November. That tool helped show the potential of generative AI to a broader audience.
Nvidia’s stock run-up of more than 200% this year has eclipsed the gains of all others in the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.
The company’s gains are all the more remarkable because it can’t sell its full lineup to the largest chip market, China. The US government requires Nvidia to obtain licenses to supply Chinese customers with its best-performing AI-related chips.
The announcement of that rule last year put a dent in shipments to the Asian nation and forced Nvidia to rework one of its key products. The company depowered one of its graphics processor units, or GPUs, to make sure it didn’t trigger the China restriction. But the Biden administration is considering new regulations that could limit sales of that component as well, Bloomberg has reported.
Nvidia’s CFO Kress addressed that possibility Wednesday on the call.
“Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results,” she said.
Nvidia also has become more important as a tech industry bellwether. The chipmaker’s forecasts provide a window into the plans of some of the world’s most valuable companies — and indicate how much those businesses are willing to spend to overhaul computer systems to accommodate AI.

The Human Rights Foundation’s Uyghur Forced Labor Checker had been experiencing a spate of unusual activity in recent months, with the number of downloads fluctuating dramatically, according to Claudia Bennett, the nonprofit’s legal and program officer. The tool, a Google Chrome extension, alerts internet users if a retailer or business whose website they are visiting has links to forced Uyghur labor.
Human Rights Foundation won a Webby People’s Voice award in public service and activism in 2022. In May, the organization’s legal department alerted Google to a barrage of one-star ratings, which they suspected were part of a computer bot attack. The reviews in question came from accounts using similar cartoon avatars as profile pictures, had nonsensical first and last names, and spoke in broken English, according to screenshots seen by Bloomberg News.
“Malicious slander,” one of the reviews stated. “Leakage of privacy,” claimed another. A third said, “Isn’t it too boring.”
A Google spokesperson said the company carefully monitors the Chrome Web Store and removes reviews that violate its policies, including those removed from the Uyghur Forced Labor Checker. It wasn’t clear who was behind the negative reviews.
The US has accused China of forcing Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region to work under what officials have described as a broader campaign of genocide.

Better Home & Finance Holding Co.’s flummoxing 96% plunge during its Thursday debut highlights how risky it is to flip speculative companies that only have a tiny pool of shares available for trading, even as bets on another such firm, VinFast Auto Ltd., appears to have paid off this week.
Only a fraction of Better shares were available for trading after a vast majority of investors opted to cash in their investments before the SPAC tie-up was completed, SPAC Research data analyzed by Bloomberg shows. This drove declines on Thursday from the $17.44 price that Aurora Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that Better merged with, closed at the day before.
The highly anticipated debut of Better comes more than two years after a May 2021 merger pact with Aurora which valued the company at more than $6 billion, back when blank-check mania was holding near its peak and investors happily paid up for a piece of the action. Now, Better joins the nearly 150 de-SPACS — firms that complete deals with blank-check companies — to erase more than 85% of their value.
When the SPAC was still trading under the ticker “AURC,” investors flipped the tiny-float stock to push it as high as $62.91, a 529% increase from the $10 value the company went public at in March 2021. The mania surrounding investors looking to dip in and out of low-float stocks has been a trend since the SPAC bubble burst, most recently driving VinFast to a valuation that makes it larger on paper than the likes of Citigroup Inc.
While Better’s deal brought in a small amount of cash from the SPAC investors, the company issued and sold senior subordinated convertible notes worth roughly $528 million to SoftBank, a regulatory filing shows.
The merger also faced an inquiry from US regulators that focused in part on founder and Chief Executive Officer Vishal Garg. However, the companies said in a filing this month that Securities and Exchange Commission staff concluded the investigation without an enforcement action.
Garg, who currently serves as the company’s chief executive, had taken leave in late 2021 after mass firing Better workers over Zoom, a move that created an uproar and led him to issue an apology.
Better is now among the 10 worst performing companies that merged with blank checks this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The once-hot industry has dried up amid a crackdown by regulators and as a glut of sponsors shut down and return cash to investors.
Better offers mortgage, real estate and homeowners’ insurance products online, and eliminates origination fees and commissions.

NVDA,2023-08-24 16:23:11,Stocks were lower on Thursday as investors digested hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve that warned interest rates will be higher for longer than initally anticipated.,"Stocks reversed lower on Thursday as another blowout quarterly earnings report from Nvidia (NVDA) couldn't overcome new comments from the Federal Reserve suggesting interest rates will need to remain elevated for a long period of time to bring inflation down.
Near noon ET on Thursday the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 1.2%, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.7%, while the Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) slipped about 0.5%, or 166 points.
In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger on Thursday, Boston Fed president Susan Collins said it is ""extremely likely"" the central bank will need to hold interest rates high to bring down inflation.
""I think that it's going to take some time to really be sure that we are seeing the sustained realignment of demand and supply that is needed in order to bring inflation back on a path that will get back to 2% [in] a reasonable amount of time,"" Collins said in an interview from the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming.
""I think it's extremely likey that we will need to hold [interest rates at current levels] for a substantial amount of time,"" Collins added, ""but exactly where the peak is I would not signal right at this point. We may be near [a peak], but we may need to increase a little bit further.
Investors will be closely watching a speech from Fed Chair Jay Powell on Friday morning for additional signals on the future path of policy.
On Wednesday, stocks finished in the green across the board ahead of Nvidia's earnings and the tech giant did not disappoint.
The company reported revenue of $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year, while adjusted earnings came in at $2.70 per share, up 429% from last year. Shares rose as much as 8% in pre-market trade on the news.
Those gains had been pared to around 2.7% by midday.

Nvidia Nears Record High as AI Demand Fuels Blowout Forecast
The company’s highest-tier “all the space you need” storage plan will be capped at about 5 terabytes per user for new customers, the company said in a blog post shared with Bloomberg to be released Thursday. That’s enough space to save about 33 million documents, Dropbox said.
While the plan was designed for businesses, some clients were instead using it for cryptocurrency mining, pooling storage with strangers, or re-selling the cloud service, Dropbox said. These uses “frequently consume thousands of times more storage than our genuine business customers, which risks creating an unreliable experience for all of our customers,” the company said.
With more than 18 million paying users, Dropbox is one of the best-known companies in the cloud storage industry and reported $2.5 billion in annual recurring revenue during its fiscal-second quarter earnings on Aug. 3. The company has worked to expand beyond storage with document management services and video-specific tools.
The change follows Alphabet Inc.’s Google removing “as much storage as you need” product branding for its highest-tier Workspace plan in May, according to copies of its website hosted on the Wayback Machine. Customers have posted on forums about being told they had exceeded storage limits and needed to pay for additional capacity. Some discussed moving to Dropbox after receiving such warnings.
A Google spokesperson said the company began rolling out “pooled storage” for customers last year, and those using over 80% of their plan’s limit will be notified. While storage policies weren’t changed in May, language was updated to “clarify that customers on these plans receive 5 TB of Drive Secure cloud storage per user with the ability to request more,” the spokesperson said.
Dropbox said it saw a surge of unintended uses the past few months “in the wake of other services making similar policy changes.” The company’s server capacity faced increased pressure in recent weeks, said a person familiar with the issue who asked not to be named discussing internal matters.
Under Dropbox’s new plan, each additional terabyte will cost $8 per month compared with the previous “as much space as needed” plan at $24 per month. Current users with less than 35 terabytes — more than 99% of top-tier plan customers — will be able to keep their current storage at the same price for five years, the company said. Those exceeding will be contacted “to discuss a range of options.”
Across the economy, more people and businesses rely on internet-based services to store and manage their files. Industry analyst IDC said that spending on cloud storage is expected to jump 25% this year to $59.9 billion, and hit $127.8 billion in 2027. For its infrastructure customers, Google increased the cost of cloud storage last year. Apple Inc. also recently raised cloud storage prices for customers in the UK. Amazon.com Inc. once offered an unlimited storage plan, before ending it in 2017. Microsoft Corp. made a similar move in 2015. Box Inc., another provider, still advertises “unlimited storage” for its enterprise plans.
“We recognize that changing an ‘all the space you need’ policy will be disappointing for some customers,” Dropbox said. “While we‘re unable to offer this option going forward, our goal is to ensure that the vast majority of teams on our Advanced plan experience no disruption.”

NVDA,2023-08-24 16:39:56,Nvidia's blowout earnings have been a tide lifting some boats.,"Nvidia's blowout (NVDA) earnings have become an earthquake sending shockwaves through tech.
The company's revenue came in at $13.51 billion, an astonishing 101% jump year-over-year, setting Wall Street abuzz.
And Nvidia's earnings are now not only about Nvidia: the tech company is now a bellwether for the AI boom, and an ecosystem has emerged in which a win for Nvidia can come in tandem with wins for other companies — as well as questions for others.
Here's who's aligned with Nvidia's rise right now – and who isn't.
The winners
Much of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" are aligning with Nvidia's rise.
""Several companies are going to benefit from this. Big Tech, like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft; so are all the banks and financial institutions that invested directly; and companies using AI, like IBM and Salesforce,"" Anat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told Yahoo Finance.
Some of the big names that experts say are primed to win with Nvidia include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (IBM).
Amazon and Microsoft are especially key as they have existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. All three companies got shoutouts towards the top of Nvidia's Wednesday earnings call.
Two under-the-radar winners who also emerged in Nvidia's earnings call: Snowflake (SNOW) and VMware (VMW), both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships.
A notable post-Nvidia spike was Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL): Shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report amid the company's stock hitting a high unseen since April 2022 earlier in the day. Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.
Ultimately, there's no bigger winner out of Nvidia earnings than Nvidia itself – and the AI boom that's propelled the chipmaker to new heights. Though the AI hype can't last forever, with this latest earnings report, Nvidia and the hype have shown some key resilience.
The losers and the question marks
Nvidia's competitors are clearly in the crosshairs: Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) all saw their shares in the red on Thursday. AMD's seeing the steepest decline, falling as much as -8%.
However, it's not curtains for non-Nvidia chipmakers, either – this is a big market and it's still early days, said Alon-Beck.
""I know that they definitely compete with each other, but that Nvidia seems to be the one that won Wall Street’s affection,"" Alon-Beck said. ""They are all important, especially with what’s happening in the international arena and the tensions with China. All of them—Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm—are in talks with U.S. officials about the China market. I don’t have a crystal ball but would think that perhaps it’s good for all of them if Nvidia continues to succeed. Yes, competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses, but there is room for all in our current market.""
Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, and that could have ramifications down the line. It all looks good mid-hype-cycle, but companies are going to have to work to meet the demand for AI by revamping their existing systems over time. Specifically, data centers – at the center of operations for essentially all tech companies – are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will be operate and grow from here.
""A company may have an allocation of [AI chips], but the next critical question is whether they have the data center capacity to make it usable,"" Tom Traugott, SVP of Strategy at EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure, told Yahoo Finance. ""AI is pushing data center buildings to be larger and denser than ever before.""

NVDA,2023-08-24 16:40:56,"Nvidia stock is roaring like many did during the 1990s bubble. But this time around, the hype around new chips is happening in a more mature demand environment.","Nvidia stock (NVDA) hit fresh all-time highs on Thursday morning with another robust quarterly earnings report pushing the stock's yearly gains to roughly 230%.
This meteoric rise, however, won't meet an end like what befell the network buildout plays that floundered after the tech boom of the 1990s, according to some on Wall Street.
""Today, we think there are many examples of companies that are generating a return using generative AI through product enhancements, productivity gains, or outright cost reductions,"" Jefferies equity analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
In contrast, the 1990s saw companies invest into a Field of Dreams-esque ""build it and they will come"" hope, Lipacis argued. Today, AI is actually changing business outlooks.
""Demand for our Data Center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers,"" Nvidia Founder & CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday.
""Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp, as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity.""
Second quarter revenue for Nvidia totaled $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year and well above Wall Street's expectations for $11.04 billion.
In the 1990s, companies like Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), and Intel (INTC) saw their share prices soar as exuberance mounted around the prospects for the chipmakers.
The New York Times even called Cisco a ""bellwether"" for the stock market in 2000. But less than a year later, the company cited a macroeconomic slowdown as it cut jobs and profits swung to losses.
Thomas Russell, then an associate professor of economics at Santa Clara University, told The Times in 2001 the slowdown at Cisco was a ""wake up call"" for the semiconductor industry, noting the roles that Cisco played in the economy moving forward hadn't changed.
All three stocks would fall about 80% as the Dotcom bubble popped.
In July, BlackRock's CIO for global fundamental equities Tony DeSpirito described demand as ""really real"" at a media roundtable and said the earnings growth from AI is ""just coming.""
Indicators that demand is outpacing Nvidia's supply have been abound on earnings calls this quarter.
In July, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company would ""take Nvidia hardware as fas as Nvidia will deliver it to us.""
During recent earnings calls, big tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also noted that Nvidia GPUs are powering some AI projects at their respective companies. Meta said generative AI is holding users on the app longer and driving additional revenue.
""Although we recognize emerging competition from the large cloud service providers (i.e. captive/internal solutions) as well as other merchant semiconductor suppliers,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari wrote in a research note on Thursday, ""we expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive moat and the urgency with which customers are developing/deploying increasingly complex AI models.""
Huang estimates there are about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise software systems. Capital spend in those industries is shifting to building out accelerated computing and generative AI capabilities, he said, but that spend is about $250 billion, indicating the transition is far from over.
""This is not a near-term thing,"" Juang said. ""This is a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.""

Borish advises retail investors to pocket some of their Big Tech gains and rejig their portfolios.
Stocks are set to drop, and a misstep by the federal government could trigger an economic catastrophe, Peter Borish has warned.
""Do I think that the S&P is likely to move down from here? Yes,"" the veteran trader said during an episode of the The Julia La Roche Show released this week.
The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed almost 16% this year, fueled by frenetic buying of artificial-intelligence stocks, and investors betting the inflation threat is over, the US economy will skirt a recession, and the Federal Reserve will reverse its interest-rate hikes soon.
Borish, a founding partner of billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corporation, noted the appeal of stocks has been sapped by bigger yields on safer assets like Treasury bonds. Moreover, higher wages and energy costs are threatening to erode corporate earnings, he said.
""I think there's going to be a little bit of a profit squeeze, which will drive prices down,"" he added.
Borish also pointed to the US dollar's recent gains against other currencies, noting a strong greenback hasn't historically been associated with outsized gains on stocks. He advised casual investors who've made a bundle on stocks like Nvidia and Apple this year to cash out some of their profits and rebalance their portfolios, even though ""that's the hardest thing in the world to do.""
Separately, the Computer Trading Corporation president flagged the risk of an economic disaster.
""My concern is not a recession or a shallow recession,"" he said. ""My concern is that if we make these gigantic policy mistakes ... then the economy could fall off a cliff.""
Borish gave the hypothetical example of congressional gridlock resulting in another government shutdown.

Stocks Drop as AI Buzz Wanes With Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap
Wall Street is swooning over Nvidia Corp.’s blockbuster quarterly results, investors are flocking to anything connected to artificial intelligence, and money managers are clamoring to put money to work after the IPO market had run dry for more than 18 months.
The key for the Softbank Group Corp.-backed company is convincing investors that its vision to be a player in AI can drive growth after sales stagnated with the semiconductor industry working through a glut of chips.
The chip designer mentioned AI roughly 50 times in a filing that laid out its ambitions to be at the center of the transition to a world increasingly dependent on AI and machine learning. That came ahead of an initial public offering slated for sometime next month, with plans to meet investors in a roadshow after Labor Day.
While Thursday’s Nvidia-fueled rally was short-lived, the company is up more than 230% this year having added more than $820 billion in market value. That’s partly due to Nvidia being the best positioned company to benefit from an AI transition, something Arm is looking to tap into given the California-based chipmaker is among its hundreds of customers.
“I’m sure Arm is cheering this morning that Nvidia had a great quarter, I’m sure that makes this a lot easier for them,” said Chris Smith, the portfolio manager of Artisan Partner’s Antero Peak Group, which oversees more than $3 billion. That said, “the actual exposure to AI is much much lower at Arm” and peers than it is for Nvidia, he said by phone.
The market for semiconductors has grown tremendously since 2016 when SoftBank purchased the company for $32 billion, Smith pointed out. The firm confirmed in its filing this week that it had bought back a 25% stake in Arm from its Vision Fund for $16.1 billion, valuing the company at more than $64 billion.
That sets the stage for Arm to break a freeze across IPOs in the US as it talks up the outlook for AI, while looking to benefit from the year’s gains for many of its customers. Since the start of the year, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rallied nearly 40%, more than double the gains for the broader S&P 500 market benchmark.

Markets have cheered companies with exposure to AI since ChatGPT took the world by storm late last year. Smaller companies like Super Micro Computer Inc., C3.ai Inc., and Palantir Technologies Inc. have all more than doubled in market value this year.
Just $14.4 billion have been raised through IPOs on US exchanges this year, a drop from this time last year and a 94% plunge from 2021’s record year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That lines Arm up to help break a drought that’s kept companies on the sidelines as they wait for a more attractive environment.
“If there is a company that the IPO market will open for, Arm seems to be that kind of company,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a phone interview. “If we’re not at peak AI enthusiasm, we’re probably fairly near it, and that’s certainly a beneficial time if you’re trying to market an IPO that can plausibly say they’re attuned to AI.”
The dearth of IPOs this year hasn’t been aligned with broader poor market fundamentals that hit sentiment in 2022. Major stock benchmarks, despite a pullback this month, have rallied back to levels seen in April 2022, while the VIX fear gauge has held below 20 since late March — a key level for bankers seeking a less volatile equity market for pricing stock offerings.

NVDA,2023-08-24 18:00:04,"After the Salesforce-led funding round, Hugging Face joins the $4 billion club of A.I. unicorns along with Anthropic and Stability AI.","Another artificial intelligence super-unicorn is in town. Hugging Face, a New York-based company providing open-source A.I. developer platforms, has raised $235 million in a series D funding round led by Salesforce that values the startup at $4.5 billion, the company announced today (Aug. 24). Other participating investors included Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, IBM and Sound Ventures. The colossal valuation puts Hugging Face among the highest-valued A.I. startups in the market along with Anthropic and Stability AI, both claiming a private market worth over $4 billion.
Before the latest round, Hugging Face had raised $160 million in venture funding and was valued at $2 billion at the end of a series C round in May 2022. The latest capital infusion brought the company’s valuation to more than 100 times its annualized revenue, according to The Information. Hugging Face didn’t comment on its revenue figure.
Who are the key people at Hugging Face and what’s its product?
Hugging Face was founded in 2016 by French entrepreneurs Clément Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf originally to develop a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. Delangue serves as the company’s CEO, and Chaumond is the chief technology officer. Wolf leads the company’s open-source and science teams, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Today, Hugging Face’s main product is a platform for A.I. developers to share open-source code and training models—similar to the way Github lets developers store software code. The company said its platform now hosts more than 50,000 organizations and over a million repositories, including 500,000 models, 250,000 datasets and 250,000 “spaces,” where users and companies create machine learning apps.
All participating investors in the series D funding round are users of Hugging Face’s platform. They have collectively shared over 1,000 open models and datasets with more than 10,000 employees through the platform to collaborate and deploy A.I. models, the company said.
In addition to the developer platform, Hugging Face also makes an original language model called Bloom, a rival of the GPT language model powering ChatGPT. Bloom is a multilingual large language model with 176 billion parameters. The free version of ChatGPT, powered by GPT-3.5, has 175 billion parameters.
Hugging Face is one of the seven A.I. companies that have agreed to open up their A.I. systems for public review as part of a joint effort with the Biden administration to ensure safe and responsible innovation in A.I.
Hugging Face currently has 170 employees. The new funding will be used to “grow the team and invest in more open-source A.I. and platform-building,” the company said.
“My priority for the next month? Hiring, hiring, hiring with a big focus on diversity!” CEO Delangue wrote in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday (Aug. 22).

AI, which is used to simulate human intelligence in machines and computer systems, is becoming widely accepted across various industries to boost productivity, efficiency and quality of service.
Artificial Intelligence: ChatGPT Was Given $20K To Invest in Stocks and Crypto — Here’s How It Made $2,000 in a Month
Learn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000
According to Statista and Next Move Strategy Consulting, the global AI market should grow from 2023’s projection of just under $208 billion to over $1.8 trillion by the end of the decade as a vast number of businesses adopt artificial intelligence within their operating structures.
But just because the awareness, possibilities and growth of AI seem limitless, that doesn’t mean that the industry won’t have short-term corrections. This boom is a great time to research AI companies and buy the dip. In fact, you can even use an AI-powered EFT to provide your portfolio exposure to a broad range of the best AI companies.
Although you might have missed the chance to buy into chipmaker Nvidia when it was trending lower (its stock price has grown over 173% in the past year and it recently became a $1 trillion company), there are plenty of opportunities for investors to capitalize on the massive return potential of AI at a relative bargain.
Here are five options that are being closely followed by dip experts, including small and big tech stocks.
Nerdy (NYSE: NDRY)
Starting with a stock under $10 (currently sitting around $4.55 USD), Insider Monkey is hyping Nerdy — the digital learning platform in the U.S. that provides live online tutoring in multiple formats — and others are joining in. Nerdy’s stock price has gone up by 92.4% in 2023 year-to-date, and the company’s shares are up by 89.0% since Oct. 2022, according to Seeking Alpha, which maintains a Buy rating for Nerdy.
With forthcoming growth in its institutional and consumer businesses (the company has launched more software products recently and plans on targeting bigger schools and school districts), valuation re-rating should be on its way.
HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS)
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based HubSpot is primarily known as a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform and a great place to work (named the #2 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor in 2022). As The Motley Fool noted, the company is dedicated to using AI in innovative ways, by employing generative AI to improve marketing strategies and better customers’ efficiency and reduce human errors.
Although it has hit recent bumps, its two AI products, ChatSpot and Content Assistant have “increased by ten times since its introduction in June, with 26% of HubSpot’s enterprise customers using it.”
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)
It would’ve been easy to just list the top five mega-cap tech AI stocks and be done with it, but where’s the fun in that? The biggest names in tech and AI are some of the biggest companies in the world, like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet (Google). But bargains are relative. Just because a company is gigantic, it doesn’t mean it isn’t mispriced.
Crunching numbers for Seeking Alpha, Steven Cress found that Meta’s command of social media and virtual reality has helped it break through with AI-driven products too. Meta is up 130% year-to-date and exceeded second-quarter expectations in earnings per share by $0.09 ($2.98) and revenue by more than 11% year-over-year ($32 billion). Growth and profitability remain strong and growth is near-certain, making its current stock price attractive, and even a plausible bargain.
Palantir (NYSE: PLTR)
A risky buy, not because of any growth potential worries, but because shares have already gained significantly this year and profits have been increasing only modestly every quarter. AI technology has predicted strong growth for the AI-powered data-mining and analytics specialists and ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood recently snapped up $12.5 million in Palantir Technologies shares. The company also announced a high-profile contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command last quarter, per CNBC.
While recent earnings have been as expected and stock overvalued, per some pundits, PLTR is up 166% so far this year and holds a #2 Buy rank with Zacks.
“We anticipate that we will become eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 after we report our financial results for Q3 2023 in early November,” said CEO Alex Karp in a shareholders letter. “At that point, we will have been profitable on a cumulative basis over the preceding four quarters.”

Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG)
Intuitive Surgical is a pioneer in the field of robotic-assisted surgery and has used AI to its maximum advantage in its da Vinci surgical system, which has “robotic arms that precisely mimic a surgeon’s hand movements to perform general, bariatric, and urology procedures in a minimally invasive fashion,” per The Motley Fool.
On July 20, ISRG announced its 2Q earnings, which beat Wall Street expectations in revenue and EPS estimates. Second-quarter revenue increased to $1.76 billion, up 15% from $1.52 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and enjoyed revenue increases across the board, on instruments and accessories, systems, operations and net income. It won’t necessarily be cheap, but Intuitive Surgery is a good example of a company that would appeal to long-term, higher-risk investors who can afford to buy.

NVDA,2023-08-24 19:01:44,Nvidia addressed concerns about its ability to meet customer demand and the potential impact of fresh sanctions against exports to China during its latest earnings call.,"Nvidia (NVDA) reported blowout second quarter results Wednesday, crushing Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom line. But perhaps the most important news came during the company’s earnings call when CFO Colette Kress attempted to assuage investors’ concerns about a supply crunch and the impact of further US sanctions against China.
Nvidia, Kress told analysts, is well positioned on both fronts.
“Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs,” Kress said. “We have also developed and qualified additional capacities and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process.”
According to Kress, Nvidia expects supplies to increase each quarter through next year, which should help the company meet the massive ramp-up in demand it’s experiencing as the AI craze continues to pick up steam.
In the latest quarter, Q2, Nvidia’s revenue jumped some 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, while earnings per share rose 429% to $2.70. And demand isn’t slowing, as the company said it expects to bring in $16 billion in revenue in the current quarter, plus or minus 2%. That’s well ahead of analysts’ forecast of $12.5 billion.
Kress also hit on whether additional US sanctions on selling high-end chips to China would take a bite out of Nvidia’s revenue moving forward: She said the company shouldn’t face any problems.
“We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results given the strength of demand for our products worldwide,” Kress said. “We do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact or financial results.”
Proving the big names are still buying
In addition to tamping down on fears that Nvidia could face an inventory shortfall — or that it will be hurt by increasing tensions between the US and China — Kress pointed to a number of big-name companies that continue to buy up Nvidia’s products.
“Data center … revenue nearly tripled year on year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies,” she said.
“Major companies including AWS (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle Cloud (ORCL), as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers, are deploying, in volume, HDX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture tensor core GPUs.”
As for how long Nvidia can keep up this kind of growth, CEO Jensen Huang pointed to the enormity of the global data center market — and the need for companies to lean further into accelerated computing and AI.
“There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spent each year. You're seeing that the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today: accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang said.
“This is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition. And we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time,” he added.
Nvidia, though, needs to ensure it can hold on to its lead in the chip space throughout that transition. But with rivals AMD, Intel, and others looking to topple the AI giant, that could be a difficult task.

Here's what they do.","Generative AI is shifting tectonic plates in the technology industry, prompting a tsunami of investment into the private sector and product development.
Salesforce (CRM), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), the Ashton Kutcher-founded Sound Ventures, and various other investors are driving the latest capital infusion in a $235 million series D funding round for Hugging Face — the open-source AI technology unicorn now valued at $4.5 billion. (And yes, it is named after an emoji.)
""We're super excited about this round,"" Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""It’s kind of like a great validation for Hugging Face, but also for open source AI as a whole. We're going to use this money to really double down on the team — hire more great people — and really double down on our investments in open-source AI and collaboration features of our platform.""
Hugging Face currently touts 500,000 language learning models, 250,000 datasets, and 50,000 organizations on the platform.
While currently still private, Delangue said he is keen on listing the company's public equity on the Nasdaq when time comes, especially since selling the growth story to investors could prove easier once margins are proven to be sustainable.
Semiconductor companies led generative AI-related equity market price action early, and now datasets are gaining traction as generative AI prompts every business to consider where it can increase productivity and create profit producing customer connections.
An extremely significant stamp of approval, both large-cap and mega-cap companies who have benefitted the most from early AI demand are participants in this round of funding for Hugging Face.
""I think we’ve validated last year that there was massive usage for generative AI,"" Delangue said. ""This year, we’re validating that there’s massive revenue for generative AI — with Nvidia, with the announcement of Hugging Face and others — and hopefully next year, we are going to validate that there’s margins for generative AI too. So it’s a very exciting kind of maturing cycle for generative AI.""

Its stock keeps rising, making CEO Jensen Huang about $4 billion richer.
He's now worth about $46 billion, per Bloomberg, making him one of the world's 25 wealthiest people.
Nvidia beat even Wall Street's lofty expectations Wednesday with a surge in second-quarter revenue to $13.5 billion – about double the same period last year.
Investors cheered the stellar results, sending shares in the AI chipmaker up 8% in pre-market trading Thursday.
The stock surge is making Nvidia's CEO, the leather-jacket-wearing Jensen Huang, even richer.
He owns almost 87 million shares, or a 3.5% stake in the Santa Clara-based chipmaker, per its most recent annual report.
Huang's now about $4 billion richer, bringing his net worth to about $46 billion, Bloomberg reported. That's a rise of about $32 billion rise this year, reflecting the 229% rise in Nvidia stock – the best performer on the S&P 500 index.
That would put him up four places on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to 25th spot – above names such as Ken Griffin, the Citadel CEO, and Blackstone boss Stephen Schwarzman.
Huang is said to have got an Nvidia-inspired tattoo on his arm when the company's share price hit $100. The stock closed Wednesday at $471.
He founded Nvidia in 1993 and it's now the leading maker of chips used for AI software.
""This build-out is unlike anything we have seen since the internet in 1995 and the ramifications are just starting to ripple through the consumer/enterprise landscape,"" Wedbush analysts said Wednesday.

Nvidia's market value jumped a whopping $90 billion in Thursday's premarket trades after the leading chipmaker unveiled another set of stellar earnings numbers.
The Santa Clara-based company's stock jumped by about 8% to $508.41 apiece in early trades as investors cheered the impressive results. That's boosted its market capitalization by about $90 billion to a new record of $1.256 trillion, Insider calculations show.
On Wednesday, the firm announced blowout second-quarter results – its revenue of $13.51 billion for the period was 88% higher than the previous quarter and up 101% from a year ago.
Nvidia is the best-performing name of the year on the S&P 500 index of US shares, with a stunning 222% year-to-date rally that was powered by the ChatGPT-fueled artificial-intelligence hype. The semiconductor firm is seen as well positioned to benefit from the burgeoning demand for high-end computing infrastructure that's required for Ai operations.
Traders have piled into the chipmaker's stock this year, along with other Big Tech names including Apple, Meta, and Alphabet thanks to the AI hype, which has helped lift the entire stock market this year. The rally boosted Nvidia's market cap above $1 trillion for the first time ever in May, allowing the firm to join an elite club of highly valued companies including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.
""The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia just gave robust guidance that will be heard around the world. AI demand off the charts,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a post on X.
Other market experts also weighed in on Nvidia's strong results. ""NVDA blew away expectations again,"" 40-year market veteran Jim Bianco said in another post on X. ""NVDA's beat is pushing the entire S&P about 0.50% higher (or about 25 points),"" he added.

His comments follow the chip maker's second quarter results, in which it said it pulled in a record $13.51 billion in revenue over the last three-month period. That's 20% above the expected $11.22 billion in revenue, and an 101% increase from revenue recorded last year, the firm said.
Nvidia stock, meanwhile, jumped as much as 7% to $506 a share in early Thursday trading. The stock pared gains to about 3% shortly after the opening bell.
But the results from the last quarter aren't enough to justify the billions Nvidia has tacked on in market cap, Trainer said. Given its current price, the company would need to grow its revenue by around 20% a year over the next quarter century, a tough prospect even in the face of booming AI demand.
What's more, Nvidia is likely to face more and more competition as time goes on, Trainer said. While Nvidia may look like the top dog and the only game in town with its H100 GPUs in huge demand, it likely won't always be the only player in the space with the tech required to power the AI revolution.
""It makes absolutely no sense to be buying shares of Nvidia at its current valuation,"" Trainer said.

""We have little doubt that Nvidia will sell every GPU it can secure from TSMC in the quarters ahead,"" Morningstar said.
Nvidia's blockbuster second-quarter earnings report was enough to convince the last bear on Wall Street to throw in the towel.
Morningstar Research analyst Brian Colello upgraded Nvidia to ""hold"" from its Wall Street-equivalent rating of ""sell"" in a note on Wednesday. He increased his ""fair value"" estimate for Nvidia to $480 from $300.
Nvidia reported second-quarter revenue of $13.5 billion, beating analyst estimates of $11.1 billion. Just a few months ago analysts expected revenue of about $7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 topped estimates of $2.09.
For the third quarter, Nvidia sees revenue of about $16 billion, well ahead of the consensus for $12.4 billion.
""We are now much more optimistic about the rise of AI workloads and how Nvidia's wide moat should cement itself as an AI chip leader,"" Colello said.
""Based on the results, guidance, and supply expansion at key partners like TSMC, we forecast that Nvidia's data center business, which includes AI graphics processors, will generate $41 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024. This compares with $15 billion a year ago and only $3 billion just four years ago,"" he added.
The bullishness from Colello could have staying power based on Nvidia's solid results, according to the note. He called Nvidia's capital allocation ""exemplary"" and described the company's economic moat as ""wide.""
One of the big worries for Nvidia investors is that its current surge in business is a pull-forward in demand that will be short-lived. But Colello disagrees.
""We could be wrong, but we see little evidence that these GPU orders are up-front spending or a one-time build... We anticipate further growth of $60 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, rising to $100 billion in fiscal 2028. Such growth might be unprecedented in large-cap tech, but we foresee all types of enterprises investing in AI,"" Colello said.
""We have little doubt that Nvidia will sell every GPU it can secure from TSMC in the quarters ahead.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks sold off and the dollar scaled an 11-week peak against major peers on Friday, as investors braced for the risk of a hawkish tilt from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole.
U.S. yields stabilised below 14-year highs. Crude oil found its footing around one-month lows, but remained on course for a second weekly decline amid a firmer dollar and simmering China-centered worries about global growth.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China set a much stronger-than-anticipated official mid-point for the yuan - something it has done every day this week - to keep a floor under its currency amid the strains from a robust dollar and a sputtering economy.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares sagged 1.2%, but remained on track for a 0.5% gain for the week, which would snap a three-week run of declines.
Nerves ahead of Powell's speech at the Fed's annual retreat for global central bankers, including the Bank of Japan's Kazuo Ueda and European Central Bank's Christine Lagarde, encouraged traders to cash in on the tech-led rally after chip designer Nvidia's extremely strong financial results following Wednesday's closing bell.
The tech-centric Nasdaq slumped 2.2% to lead losses of more than 1% across Wall Street's three major indexes, and futures indicated a flat start at the reopen.
Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2%, with Nvidia supplier Advantest the biggest drag, crashing almost 10%.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 1.1%, with a tech subindex dropping 1.7%. Mainland blue chips drooped 0.4%.
""It's all down to Powell,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index.
""In all likelihood, he'll peddle the 'higher for longer' narrative which is likely already priced in, and that leaves the potential for a 'buy the rumour, sell the fact' response,"" Simpson said.
""However, there is also no real reason for Powell to strike a dovish tone,"" he added, ""and that could mean an ugly end to the week for stocks, while the dollar shines.""
The Fed has been raising rates since March 2022 in an effort to bring down inflation, and investors are looking for clarity on whether more rate increases are ahead and how long the Fed plans to hold rates high.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker set the stage in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, saying he doubted the central bank will need to raise rates again, but also indicated he was not ready to predict when rate cuts might begin.
The U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against a basket of six developed-market peers, including the euro and yen - pushed as high as 104.20 in Asia, a level last seen in early June.
The euro sank to the lowest since mid-June at $1.07845.
Against Japan's currency, the dollar edged back toward last week's nine-month high of 146.545, last trading at 146.15.
Tokyo consumer price data on Friday, which front-runs nationwide figures, showed inflation remained well above the BOJ's target, but slowed for a second straight month, implying less pressure on the BOJ to imminently tweak policy again.
The Japanese government bond market was quiet, with the benchmark 10-year note yet to change hands on the day. The yield retreated to 0.645% on Thursday after hitting a 9-1/2-year peak of 0.675% in the previous session. The BOJ unexpectedly doubled the de-facto policy cap on the yield to 1% at the end of last month.
Equivalent U.S. Treasury yields ticked up in Asia time, last sitting at 4.245%, off the previous session's low of 4.174% but well back from Tuesday's peak of 4.366%, the highest level since November 2007.
The Chinese yuan traded slightly weaker in offshore markets, slipping 0.07% to 7.2866 per dollar. For the week though, it has firmed about 0.28%, pulling away from Thursday's 9-1/2-month trough of 7.349.
On top of strong signalling with the official mid-point, the PBOC was also directing domestic banks to scale back outward investments, shrinking the supply of yuan overseas.
In energy markets, crude prices eased further on Friday, staying on track for weekly declines of between 2-3%. Brent crude fell 16 cents, or 0.2%, to $83.20 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 18 cents, or 0.2%, to $78.91 a barrel. [O/R]

Investors in the index are speculating on just a few companies, Apollo's Marc Rowan says.
Rowan says it's a tougher backdrop today, echoing one of his key influences, Warren Buffett.
The S&P 500 has become so concentrated that investors are basically betting on a handful of mega-cap stocks like Tesla and Nvidia, Marc Rowan has warned.
""I don't even know if we have a stock market anymore – 10 stocks are like 35% of the US S&P 500, and 80% of volume is in the S&P 500,"" he told The Australian Financial Review in a recent interview.
""You're not an investor, you're a speculator,"" the Apollo Global Management CEO added.
The S&P 500 weights its constituents by market capitalization, meaning companies with trillion-dollar market caps like Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have outsized influence among the roughly 500 stocks in the benchmark index.
Rowan also issued a caution to Australian investors that likely pertains to their US peers too. Years of rock-bottom interest rates and carefree government spending meant ""everything went up,"" but that's no longer the case now rates are higher, he said.
""The strategies that powered you along the way are unlikely to power you going forward,"" Rowan said.
Warren Buffett shared a similar message during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders' meeting in May. He declared an ""extraordinary"" and ""incredible"" period for the US economy was over, and said it was a ""different climate"" compared to six months earlier.
It's little surprise that Rowan and Buffett have similar outlooks, given the Apollo chief has partly modeled his company on Berkshire.
Buffett's conglomerate uses ""float"" — the money left over from its insurance businesses after premiums are collected and claims are paid — to feed its cash-hungry subsidiaries and fund its purchases of stocks, bonds, businesses, and other assets.
Apollo secured its own source of permanent capital when it acquired Athene, a retirement-services business, at the start of 2022. The asset manager takes the excess life-insurance and annuity payments gathered by Athene and uses them to make investments.
Moreover, Apollo outbid Berkshire for Tech Data in 2019, underscoring that Rowan and Buffett have similar tastes in businesses.
Buffett hasn't voiced the same concerns as Rowan about the intense concentration of Big Tech in the S&P 500. One reason might be that Berkshire owns nearly 6% of Apple, and the iPhone maker accounted for roughly 50% of the total value of its stock portfolio — and 17% of its $1 trillion of assets — at the end of June.","S&P 500 investors are betting on a handful of stocks like Tesla and Nvidia, Apollo's Marc Rowan warns",471.63,460.17999,468.35001,8,2023,25

But contrasting developments at the two firms are causing their price-to-earnings valuations to converge. Nvidia’s earnings estimates jumped in the wake of its blowout AI-fueled results Thursday, pushing its forward PE multiple down to 35 times compared with over 60 in May.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nvidia's move to buy back $25 billion of its shares after its stock has more than tripled this year caught some investors off-guard, even as they cheered a stellar second-quarter report.
Shares of Nvidia touched a record high on Thursday, a day after the company blew past expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast as an artificial-intelligence boom fueled demand for its chips. Nvidia shares, which had run up in the days leading up to its report, climbed more than 6% on Thursday but pared gains to end the day little changed.
However, Nvidia's stock buyback - the fifth-biggest repurchase announcement among U.S.-based companies this year, according to EPFR - surprised some investors.
Companies commonly repurchase their stock as a way to return capital to shareholders. Such buybacks can benefit a stock's price by reducing the supply of shares and increasing demand, and can boost earnings per share, a closely watched investor metric.
But while shareholders often see buybacks as an encouraging sign when a company’s stock appears cheap, Nvidia’s shares have shot up some 220% in 2023, leaving investors searching for the reasons behind the company’s move.
""It's a little bit of a head-scratcher,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management, which has $2.5 billion in assets under management and counts Nvidia as a top-10 holding.
""As a shareholder, we like to see stock buybacks, but for a company like Nvidia that is growing so fast, you kind of want to see their earnings being plowed back in to the company,” Lip added.
As opposed to companies with sluggish financial performance growth that turn to buybacks to help prop up earnings per share, the announcement from Nvidia ""comes as a surprise"" given that they are ""a hot growth tech name,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns Nvidia shares.
""The message seems to be that (Nvidia's) management believes that their stock is undervalued,"" Morgan said.
GENERATING CASH
For some investors, an ""undervalued"" Nvidia might be a difficult message to stomach. Nvidia shares traded at 45 times forward 12-month earnings estimates as of Wednesday compared with about 19 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
""Historically, you'd love it when a company is able to buy their stock back when it is depressed, but I don't think anybody can make the case that it is at a depressed place right now,"" said Tom Plumb, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its largest holdings.
However, Plumb said, the company might be limited in how it can deploy its resources after its deal to buy semiconductor designer Arm Holdings Ltd collapsed last year amid regulatory concerns.
""They're generating incredible amounts of cash, more than they need for their current investment strategy, and they're prohibited from buying significant complementary businesses,"" Plumb said. ""So what are they going to do with their cash?""
Nvidia spent about 27% of revenue on research and development last year, in line with rival chip companies.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In its second-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, Nvidia said its board approved $25 billion in additional share repurchases ""without expiration,"" and that the company plans to continue repurchases this fiscal year.
Despite the staggering dollar amount, Nvidia's buyback amounted to only 2.1% of its nearly $1.2 trillion market value, or buyback yield, as of Wednesday. That is less than the historic 2.58% buyback yield for the overall S&P 500, when looking over one-year periods, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Meanwhile, several other megacap tech and growth companies have announced even bigger buybacks this year: Apple at $90 billion, Alphabet at $70 billion and Meta Platforms at $40 billion.
Tech companies tend to prefer using cash for buybacks over dividends, because ""if they are on the hook for a dividend every quarter that may hinder their ability to take advantage of growth opportunities,"" said Daniel Klausner, head of U.S. public equity advisory at Houlihan Lokey.
Indeed, some investors welcomed Nvidia's buyback decision.
""It’s a show of confidence,"" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/M Investments' large cap focused fund, which holds Nvidia shares. ""If they had better use for (the cash), I am pretty sure they would have done it.""

Tokyo consumer price data on Friday, which front-runs nationwide figures, showed inflation remained well above the BOJ's target. However, the lag in pay raises may be more pivotal for steering policy.
""We do not expect the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy because the spike in inflation has not spilled over to a large acceleration in wage growth,"" CBA strategist Joseph Capurso wrote in a client note.
At the same time, if Powell is not considered ""hawkish enough"" by currency traders at Jackson Hole, the dollar may ease to around 145 yen to end the week, he said.

High on regional investors' minds is the speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, scheduled for later in the day. He’ll be speaking at an event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that has been the site of major policy announcements by the Fed.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 dropped 1.3% for its worst loss in three weeks. That nearly wiped out its gain for the week, which had been a bright spot in what's been a rough August.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 1.9%.
Stocks sank as Treasury yields stabilized following their tumble a day earlier. High yields in the bond market have been upping the pressure because they make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks and other risky investments. They may be set to go even higher, depending on what the head of the Federal Reserve says.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.20% late Wednesday. It fell there from 4.33% a day before, close to its highest level since 2007.
Yields found some traction following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. Another said orders for long-lasting manufactured goods slumped by more last month than economists expected.
For now, weaker-than-expected reports on the economy may be more welcome in financial markets. The economy has managed to avoid a long-predicted recession, but the fear is that it's so solid that it will keep upward pressure on inflation.
The Federal Reserve has already raised its main interest rate to the highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding down high inflation. High rates work to do that by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for investments.
Hope had built that the Fed’s latest rate hike in July would prove to be the last of this cycle, after inflation cooled considerably since peaking above 9% last summer. Traders also have made bets for the Fed to begin cutting rates in early 2024. But a series of stronger-than-expected reports on the economy has diminished those hopes.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves closely with expectations for the Fed, rose to 5.01%. A day before, it had dropped to 4.98% from 5.05% after a report suggested U.S. business activity is cooling in August.
That weaker-than-expected report pushed John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, to think Powell may not sound as aggressive about keeping rates high.
But he still says Powell “will likely express concerns about inflation not falling fast enough and that the market should not expect any cuts through at least the first part of 2024.”
Thursday's weakness for stocks came despite a much stronger-than-expected profit report from Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks. That raised hopes that this year’s frenzy on Wall Street around artificial intelligence technology isn’t just hype.
Nvidia first stunned the market three months ago when it said the quick adoption of AI would send its revenue soaring in the three months through July. Its sales came in even better than forecast, at $12.51 billion, and the company gave a forecast for the current quarter that again blew past Wall Street’s expectations.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 59.70 points to 4,376.31. The Dow dropped 373.56 to 34,099.42, and the Nasdaq sank 257.06 to 13,463.97.
In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 27 cents to $79.32 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 25 cents to $83.61 a barrel.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 146.12 Japanese yen from 145.81 yen. The euro cost $1.0792, down from $1.0819.

NVDA,2023-08-25 10:07:58,"NVIDIA Corporation ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial...","NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. The stock price has risen 8.9% to US$472 over the past week, suggesting investors are becoming more optimistic. It will be interesting to see if this latest upgrade is enough to kickstart further buying interest in the stock.
After the upgrade, the 51 analysts covering NVIDIA are now predicting revenues of US$54b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a sizeable 66% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to surge 131% to US$9.63. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$44b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.62 in 2024. There has definitely been an improvement in perception recently, with the analysts substantially increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates.
View our latest analysis for NVIDIA
It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for NVIDIA 19% to US$620 on the back of these upgrades.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The analysts are definitely expecting NVIDIA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 175% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 25% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 15% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry.
The Bottom Line
The most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates for this year, expecting improving business conditions. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for this year, and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. With a serious upgrade to expectations and a rising price target, it might be time to take another look at NVIDIA.
Even so, the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. We have estimates - from multiple NVIDIA analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

Marvell Technology's (MRVL): Shares of the chipmaker lost roughly 8% Friday morning following second quarter results that were slightly better than anticipated, but still showed a revenue decline of 12% compared to last year. The decline also coincided with a blowout quarter from Nvidia.
Hawaiian Electric (HE): The island’s largest utility continued its plunge, dropping 16% after local authorities filed suit against the company accusing it of negligence by failing to shut down power lines, leading to the deadly wildfires.

A rollercoaster morning for stocks
Stocks were whipping around in morning trade on Friday as investors worked to find a clear direction following Fed Chair Jay Powell's speech in Jackson Hole.
With the Fed chair unequivocal in his view the Fed will work to bring inflation back to its 2% target, stocks initially fell as Powell's remarks were released.
A rally soon ensued, with the Nasdaq rising as much as 1%. At least one Wall Street expert in our inbox pointed to Powell's comment which said, ""Given how far we have come, at upcoming meetings we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.""
""Proceed carefully"" being a sign for investors an easier Fed could be coming into view.
By 10:45 a.m. ET, however, stocks had moved into red figures with the Nasdaq down 0.3%, the S&P 500 off 0.2%, and the Dow down 0.1%.
Powell's outline for the Fed's next moves, however softened on the margins, only really opened two possibilities for interest rates in the near term: unchanged or higher.
'We are prepared to raise rates further'
Fed Chair Jay Powell's highly-anticipated speech from Jackson Hole on Friday was largely a reiteration of the message he's been trying to get across for months — the Fed will not quit in its fight to bring inflation back to 2%.
The key pull from Powell's speech is right at the top (emphasis ours):
""At last year's Jackson Hole symposium, I delivered a brief, direct message. My remarks this year will be a bit longer, but the message is the same: It is the Fed's job to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal, and we will do so. We have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peak—a welcome development—it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.""
Elsewhere in Powell's speech, a strong economy, strong labor market, and some notable dynamics in the economy that could help ease inflation pressures get some play.
Following Powell's comments, stocks were higher.
Overall, an important examination of the economy from the Fed chair we think is worth an investor's time to read in full.
Stocks rise ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech
Wall Street rang in the day on a high note in anticipation of Fed Chair Jay Powell’s remarks at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, which is scheduled to begin less than an hour after the opening bell. The market already recoiled Thursday when Boston Fed president Susan Collins suggested higher interest rates may be needed to tame inflation, during an interview with Yahoo Finance. Market watchers will be looking for more clarity from Powell and insight on the direction of the Fed's interest rate policy.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged higher by 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced 0.5%, setting the major averages up for a win after Thursday’s tumble.

Powell acknowledges resilient economy, allowing Fed 'optionality'
During a speech on Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the string of more resilient than expected economic data investors have been digesting all summer long.
""We are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected,"" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said Friday at Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Jackson, Wyo.
He added: ""Additional evidence of persistently above-trend growth could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""
The comments come as signs of a resilient US economy have been abundant. July's retail sales report revealed the control group, which contributes directly to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rose 1.0%. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected just a 0.5% increase for the control group. The July labor report showed wages increased at 4.4% rate compared to the year prior and the unemployment rate remains historically low, while overall job additions showed signs of cooling.
The strong data had economists and even the Fed's own staff call off their 2023 recession calls while also spurring conversations of a ""soft landing"" conclusion to the Fed's hiking cycle, where inflation stabilizes without economic growth taking a significant downturn. But Chair Powell warned the path forward might not be so obvious.
""Evidence that the tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could also call for a monetary policy response,"" Powell said.
These call outs were key to how investors will dissect Powell's speech, according to EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco.
""By highlighting these [upside] risks, and noting that policymakers would proceed “carefully”, Powell maintained maximum policy optionality for upcoming meetings,"" Daco wrote in a note on Friday.

During after-market trading, the San Francisco-based company who is also among collaborators of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) rose 6% in after-market trading.
Second Quarter Results
For the quarter that ended on July 31st, Autodesk reported revenue rose 9% YoY to $1.35 billion topping estimates of $1.32 billion, but total billings contracted 8% to $1.095 billion.
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction segment rose 11% YoY, generating revenue of $627 million. Design revenue rose 8% YoY or 12% on a constant currency basis, but dropping 6% from the previous quarter. Maker revenue rose 15% YoY to $130 million, which is a 7% increase from the previous quarter. Subscription plans experienced a revenue rise of 9%, or 13% in constant currency, to $1.27 billion, which is a 6% compared to the previous quarter.
On a constant currency basis, net revenue retention rate remained within the range of 100% to 110% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.91 per share, topping profit estimates of $1.73 per share.
Outlook
The computer-aided design software company, whose software is used by construction, engineering and manufacturing companies, guided third-quarter revenue to be in the range between $1.38 billion and $1.40 billion, topping Refinitiv’s estimates of $1.38 billion, with earnings per share expected in the range between $1.97 to $2.03, also topping the estimated $1.92.
As for full fiscal year 2024, earnings per share are guided in the range between $7.30 and $7.49, above the expected $7.28. Full year revenue is expected to be between $5.41 billion and $5.46 billion, while analysts estimated $5.41 billion.
Autodesk is benefiting from the fact that companies are turning to digital transformation in an effort to overcome limitations in terms of labor, money and materials. Chief Executive Andrew Anagnost remarked that that the strong figures and positioning are owed to the AutoCad maker’s resilience, discipline and action upon new opportunities.
Anagnost also added that Autodesk was always an AI player, and it will use this technology for the purpose of boosting productivity and therefore, optimizing construction design in terms of making it cheaper and more sustainable, as opposed to automating creativity which is a source of endless opportunity.

Single-bond exchange-traded funds were also in the news this week as F/m Investments filed to create mutual fund share classes of its 10 single-bond ETFs. This would take Vanguard’s patented fund structure and turn it on its head, creating traditional mutual fund shares of ETFs. F/m’s aim is to get access to the trillions in assets stashed in 401(k) accounts, which generally don’t allow easy access to ETFs.
Tuttle Capital Management announced it was closing its Tuttle Long Cramer Tracker ETF (LJIM). The fund, which launched in March, tracked stock picks from the CNBC media personality but failed to attract more than $1.3 million in assets. Tuttle’s fund that invests the inverse of Cramer’s recommendations, the Tuttle Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), remains open.

Tech has found its way into every aspect of our lives and dominates almost all industries, including transportation, healthcare, entertainment, and education. Technological advancements have the potential to impact and transform the way consumers, industries, and businesses operate. Such a drastic and disruptive shift is primarily caused by innovative or cutting-edge technology. Cutting-edge technology includes technology that uses the latest, highest-level information technology development. By identifying emerging cutting-edge technologies, we can gauge the future trajectories of emerging and profitable industries and invest accordingly.
AI And Revival Of Enthusiasm In Tech
After a turbulent last year in investments, the tech industry has quickly recovered. Generative AI has been the major catalyst for this recovery and has found numerous applications in our daily lives, organizations, and larger industries. Leading the AI revolution, generative AI has rekindled the enthusiasm of consumers and investors alike. Many companies in the tech industry are developing cutting-edge generative AI models and products including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).
The graphic processors by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are considered vital in the development of generative AI applications including ChatGPT. The popularity of generative AI has fueled the demand for graphics chips by the company. On August 8, Reuters reported that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has announced a new configuration, GH200, for its advanced AI chips named Grace Hopper Superchip that will be available in the second quarter of 2025. This new configuration will have a higher-bandwidth memory that will speed generative AI applications further. This new chip design combines an H100 GPU with a central processor designed by the company. By providing a higher memory bandwidth, the company is facilitating generative AI applications to run smoothly without connecting to separate chips and systems. The company is correspondingly estimated to have continual growth in the future.
Another company at the forefront of developing cutting-edge technology like AI is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company has invested significantly in Open AI, the name behind ChatGPT. The company is empowering innovation and constantly rolling out new technologies and features. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has added ChatGPT to Azure cloud services and Bing. The company is growing rapidly, as evidenced by its earnings for the last quarter. On July 25, the company reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings per share of $2.69 and beat EPS estimates by $0.14. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $56.19 billion, up 8.34% year over year and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $698.86 million. Here are some comments from the company's earnings call mentioning the role of AI in its growth and plans for the future:
""We had a solid close to our fiscal year. The Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 billion in annual revenue, up 27% in constant currency, with Azure all-up accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time. Every customer I speak with is asking how and how fast they can apply next-generation AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face and do so safely and responsibly. To that end, we remain focused on 3 key priorities: first, helping customers use the breadth and depth of Microsoft Cloud to get the most value onto their spending; second, investing in leading the new AI platform shift by infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack; and third, driving operating leverage.""
Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also working on AI. On August 24, the company released a free AI model called Code Llama that will help in writing computer code. The large language model (LLM) uses text prompts to generate code. Code Llama has immense potential to catalyze the coding process and enhance productivity. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has released three versions of Code Llama with 7 billion, 13 billion, and 34 billion parameters respectively addressing different serving and latency requirements. This model could greatly benefit software engineers working in different domains. The platform supports several coding languages including Java, Python, and C++.
Tech Industry Outlook
According to a report by McKinsey, the absolute investments in tech amounted to $1 trillion in 2022. The large investment, despite a tumultuous overall situation, implies the strong faith of the investors in the growth of the tech industry. Furthermore, the decline in investments in technologies like cloud and edge computing in 2022 does not necessarily correspond to a decline in interest. The drop in investments is also an indicator that these techs are maturing and are becoming more profitable. Profitable industries can scale further with marginal investments. Therefore, the decline in investments in some technologies last year is an unreliable indicator of those technologies' future.
The tech industry has shown persistent growth over the years. With several nascent technologies on the horizon, the future of tech looks bright. The global tech industry is massive, and it is not easy to gauge the actual size of the entire industry. According to MGI Research, global tech spending is estimated to grow from $8.51 trillion in 2022 to $11.47 in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.75%. The pandemic highlighted the digital gap that exists today, accelerating the growth of this sector. Innovations and the reduction in time of the tech commoditization cycle, the time required for a product to become mainstream, contribute to continuing expansion. The interplay of technology with our daily lives is one of the strongest tailwinds for constant growth.
One of the biggest challenges the tech industry faces today is the lack of competent labor. Tech companies have been laying off people at one end while having a surge in demand for competent workers on the other. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, despite the fall in job postings globally by 13% from 2021 to 2022, the job postings in tech grew by 15%. Increased automation has amplified the demand for specialized and competent tech workers. Another major challenge is increased government regulations and scrutiny. Growing privacy concerns have caused this ripple. The governments have become more vigilant and have imposed stronger laws. The heightened mistrust has even led to the banning of platforms like ChatGPT in many countries. These strict laws restrict overall technology growth.
The world is changing rapidly under the technology revolution. The tech industry is constantly coming up with innovations. In addition to AI, there are many other technologies that are on track to become significantly valuable. Let's now take a look at the most profitable cutting-edge technologies that could make you rich.

Regulatory Hurdles in China:
NVIDIA's permission from the U.S. government to develop and export its H100 chip for the Chinese market is nearing its expiration date.
Although a new authorization has been secured, allowing R&D to continue, the direct sale of A100 and H100 chips in China remains prohibited. NVIDIA has cautioned that further U.S. restrictions could result in losing the Chinese market, the largest global market for semiconductors.
The looming expiration of the authorization period could disrupt NVIDIA's operations, Min News reports.
Record Stock Performance:
NVIDIA's stock recently hit an all-time high following a third consecutive revenue forecast that surpassed Wall Street expectations.
The company anticipates sales of around $16 billion in the upcoming quarter, outdoing analysts' estimates of $12.5 billion.
This robust performance is largely attributed to NVIDIA's pivotal role in the AI computing surge, which has helped it recover swiftly from the global chip shortage and even surpass Intel's quarterly sales for the first time, Daily Item reports.
Expanded Partnership with VMware:
NVIDIA and VMware have unveiled the VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a platform designed to facilitate the development and deployment of generative AI applications for enterprises.
This collaboration aims to address data privacy, security, and control concerns by combining NVIDIA's accelerated computing and generative AI software with VMware Cloud Foundation.

NVDA,2023-08-28 15:37:22,"A detailed exploration of NVIDIA Corp's valuation, financial strength, profitability, and growth prospects","On August 28, 2023, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) closed at $454.36, marking a -1.26% change for the day. Despite this slight dip, the company's stock has seen a 15.82% gain over the last three months. With Earnings Per Share (EPS) standing at 4.14, an important question arises: is the stock significantly overvalued? This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of NVIDIA's valuation, financial strength, profitability, and growth prospects to answer this question. Read on to discover more about this leading developer of graphics processing units.
Company Overview
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with NVDA. Click here to check it out.
NVDA 30-Year Financial Data
The intrinsic value of NVDA
NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a renowned developer of graphics processing units (GPUs). Initially, GPUs were designed to enrich the user experience on computing platforms, particularly in PC gaming applications. However, GPUs have since evolved into critical semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI). NVIDIA not only offers AI GPUs but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. The company is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.
At present, NVIDIA's stock price stands at $454.36, significantly higher than the GF Value of $339.1. The GF Value is an estimation of the stock's fair value, calculated using historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. This discrepancy suggests that NVIDIA might be significantly overvalued.
Understanding GF Value
The GF Value represents a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor derived from the company's past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line offers a visual representation of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.
Given its current price of $ 454.36 per share, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shows every sign of being significantly overvalued. Consequently, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.
Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.
Financial Strength
Investing in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Thus, it is crucial to scrutinize a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A good starting point for understanding a company's financial strength is looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. NVIDIA has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.49, which is worse than 56.38% of 885 companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, GuruFocus ranks NVIDIA's overall financial strength at 8 out of 10, indicating strong financial health.
Profitability and Growth
Companies that have consistently been profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually suggest a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. NVIDIA has been profitable 10 years over the past decade. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $32.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.14. Its operating margin is 33.04%, which ranks better than 94.76% of 936 companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, the profitability of NVIDIA is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.
Growth is probably the most crucial factor in a company's valuation. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term stock performance of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of NVIDIA is 34.5%, which ranks better than 87.86% of 865 companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 20.1%, which ranks worse than 52.99% of 768 companies in the Semiconductors industry.
ROIC vs WACC
Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, NVIDIA's ROIC was 41.98, while its WACC came in at 16.74.
Conclusion
In summary, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be significantly overvalued. While the company's financial condition is strong and its profitability robust, its growth ranks worse than 52.99% of 768 companies in the Semiconductors industry.

(Reuters) - Increased analysts' estimates since Nvidia's strong quarterly report last week have left the world's most valuable chipmaker trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in eight months.
Nvidia's stock added nearly 2% to $468 on Monday, leaving it down almost 1% since last Wednesday, when the Santa Clara, California company far exceeded expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast as an artificial-intelligence boom fueled demand for its chips.
At that price, Nvidia shares are trading at the equivalent of around 33 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv data. That forward PE compares to over 46 a week ago, and it is now at its lowest since December 2022.
Nvidia's stock has more than tripled this year amid soaring demand for its top-of-the-line processors used to power generative AI technologies that can read and write in human-like ways.
Price/earnings ratios help investors gauge the value of companies, but relying on analysts' estimates of future earnings creates uncertainty.
""Any time you use a forward-looking thing that involves an estimate in a very new market and very uncertain economic environment, I think at a minimum you have to take it with a pretty huge grain of salt,"" warned Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.
Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree has a ""buy"" rating on Nvidia but pointed to the company's reliance on Taiwanese chip foundry TSMC, which also serves Apple and other big customers, as a factor that could keep Nvidia from selling as many of its high-end chips as it would like.
""It's not just demand, but what they can actually deliver,"" Acree said.
In its report last week, Nvidia, with a stock market value of $1.14 trillion, also said it would buy back $25 billion of its shares, suggesting chief executive Jensen Huang views them as undervalued, even after gaining 220% year to date.
Following its report, analysts on average expect Nvidia's revenue for the fiscal year ending in January 2024 to reach $53 billion, nearly double the previous year, according to Refinitiv data. The company's net income is seen quintupling to over $22 billion in the same fiscal year before reaching $35 billion the following year.

But ""a tidal wave of AI-driven spending"" will fuel another rally, according to Wedbush.
""Despite a stubborn 10-year and the Fed, tech goes higher,"" analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.
Expect tech stocks' stellar run to continue thanks to a looming surge in spending on AI, according to Wedbush.
Nvidia's second-quarter earnings signaled there will be a massive rise in investment in the sector over the next 12 to 18 months that'll ease investors' worries about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes, analyst Dan Ives said in a research note seen by Insider.
""Our thoughts: despite a stubborn 10-year and the Fed, tech goes higher,"" he wrote.
""The Nvidia guidance speaks to a tidal wave of AI-driven spending on the horizon for the tech sector over the coming years,"" Ives added.
Tech stocks have soared in 2023, with the sector-tracking Nasdaq Composite index jumping 31% year-to-date.
But that rally has stalled in August, due to rising US Treasury yields – which boost bonds' appeal relative to stocks – as well as the lingering worry that the Fed will hold interest rates at a higher level for longer in a bid to prevent future inflation flare-ups.
Ives predicted the slowdown this month will prove to be a temporary blip, rather than a longer-term trend, and pointed to profit guidance numbers published last week by Nvidia as evidence of an upcoming AI spending spree.
The semiconductor giant smashed Wall Street analysts' expectations for this quarter and issued stronger-than-expected targets for the next, although its shares dipped slightly in spite of that stellar earnings report.
""It's the rocket ship-like trajectory of AI-driven growth that will hit the shores of the tech industry over the next 12-18 months that speaks to our unabated bullishness for tech stocks,"" Ives said.
""We also see an improving spending for software, chips, and digital media consumer growth into 2024,"" he added.","Tech stocks will start rallying again soon thanks to the AI 'tidal wave', Wedbush says",468.35001,487.84,492.64001,8,2023,29
NVDA,2023-08-29 18:20:00,"While teachers have banned students from using AI, some instructors are willingly bringing it into the classroom.","Come fall, there will be a new student in many classrooms: A version of artificial intelligence, or a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT that can mimic human intelligence.
While several school districts have outright banned students from using AI, other institutions are asking teachers to use their own discretion. And rather than trying to work against AI, some educators are willingly bringing it into the classroom.
""My opinion is that it is my obligation and responsibility to expose and immerse students in these generative AI tools,"" Dan Wang, a sociology professor at Columbia Business School told CBS MoneyWatch. He said the university has left it up to instructors to decide how to work with or against AI.
For his part, Wang is encouraging, and even requiring that his students use AI to complete their coursework.
AI has a giant carbon footprint. Can the technology also fight climate change?Nvidia riding high on explosive growth in AIRise of AI has actors fearing for their jobs
""The reason why is because the MBA students I teach are going to be entering the workforce in about 10 months, and they'll often be working within companies and organizations that encourage employees to make use of generative AI tools,"" Wang said.
Benefits and constraints
Wang noted that he has colleagues who have taken the opposite tack, choosing instead to restrict students from using AI as much as possible.
But Wang considers that to be a losing battle on multiple fronts. For one, he says the technology is impossible to completely rein in. Second, he believes in attempting to do so, he would be doing his students a disservice.
""The classroom is the place to help students understand the advantages and benefits of tools and, through their own use of them, their constraints,"" Wang said. ""The more students understand what they can and can't use these tools for, the more comfortable they'll be doing so in the workplace.""
Assignments he gives require students to use AI platforms as research assistants, for example.
""In my class, most assignments and exercises done in class and outside feature some aspect of generative AI that's required,"" he said. ""They range from interaction with personas that have been trained on custom generative AI models and using AI as a creative assistant.""
What he won't do, however, is rely on AI to grade or otherwise evaluate his students' work.
""I want students to know I care a lot about their work and I'm giving every attention I can spare to the work they submit,"" he said.
""Dead-end game""
Graham Glass, an AI expert and founder and CEO of Cypher Learning, a company that provides AI-powered learning platforms for school and businesses, agrees that trying to curb AI's use is a losing battle.
The solution, as he sees it, is to ""change how student work is evaluated.""
""Vetting a student essay phrase by phrase, searching for pilfered or artificially manufactured language, is a dead-end game,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""There is no payoff in a tit-for-tat escalatory conflict pitting crafty students against overworked instructors. Students will always be tempted to 'let ChatGPT do it,' and no policing software will be an airtight deterrent.""
He advises instructors to consider how AI can be an additive.
""I think enlightened educators will say things like, 'a requirement of this course is that you use AI, because the kinds of assessments I will give you, you can't do without it.'""
If he were teaching a class, as opposed to assigning students an essay to write, Glass would ask them to write a book, with the help of an AI assistant, of course.
""I'd say write an entire book with 15 chapters, an epilogue, prologue, and get five other students in the class to review it for originality, believability and writing style,"" Glass said.
This will force students to think creatively about how to employ AI, including what prompts to feed it.
""It gets them used to what's possible when humans team up with AI,"" Glass said. ""It pushes them to be more creative than ever before, while also preparing them for the age of AI.""","Educators say they are working with, not against, AI in the classroom",468.35001,487.84,492.64001,8,2023,29

The Auntie Anne's employee piled the entire sum into Tesla, Nvidia, GameStop, AMC, and other stocks.
His broker caught on and liquidated the holdings a day later, making a roughly $7,000 profit.
A fast-food worker duped his online broker into giving him $200,000 of advance credit, then plowed the ill-gotten funds into stocks including Tesla, Nvidia, GameStop, and AMC Entertainment, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Deyonte Jahtori Anthony, 23, was a part-time employee of an Auntie Anne's in North Carolina last summer. On July 1, he applied for a self-directed brokerage account, claiming he earned between $25,000 and $50,000 a year when he was only making about $400 a month, the SEC said in a complaint filed on August 25 and viewed by Insider.
Anthony linked his trading account to a bank account with only 9 cents in it, then initiated unfunded deposits totaling $1 million between July 5 and 6. The pending deposits granted him access to $200,000 in immediate credit, which he plowed into eight stocks and an exchange-traded fund on July 6, the SEC said.
The pretzel-shop worker piled about $85,000 into Apple, $78,000 into GameStop, $22,000 into Nvidia, $13,000 into AMC Entertainment, and $700 into Tesla. He invested another $800 across Cano Health, Electronic Arts, Resolute Forest Products, and ETFMG Prime Cyber Security, per the SEC.
GameStop and AMC are both ""meme stocks"" that skyrocketed in price in early 2021, as retail investors bought them en masse in a bid to punish short sellers and pocket huge gains in a matter of days. Tesla and Nvidia also have passionate fanbases who expect the pair to win big from the artificial-intelligence revolution. Intense hype has helped to nearly double and more than triple the automaker and graphics-chip company's respective stock prices this year.
The broker discovered Anthony's alleged fraud the next day, froze his account, and liquidated all of his holdings. The short-lived purchases proved lucrative; the broker made about a $7,000 profit, including a roughly $4,700 return on GameStop, $1,600 on Apple, and $800 on Nvidia. All but one of Anthony's trades were in the green when his broker cashed out, the SEC complaint shows.
Anthony wasn't able to withdraw any money before his account was frozen. His deposits were later reversed due to insufficient funds, and he was fired from Auntie Anne's on July 9 after not showing up for work. He admitted to making the deposits and misleading his broker under oath during investigative testimony, regulators said.
""When asked why he made the $1 million in unfunded deposits without having funds to cover the transactions, Anthony excused his conduct as 'a joke' and said that he 'never really thought of it as fraud,""' the SEC said.
Anthony tried to execute what's known as a ""free-riding"" scheme, where a trader makes bogus deposits to access advanced credit, then tries to use that credit to make money and withdraw it before their broker catches on and freezes their account, the federal agency explained.
The SEC said in its complaint that it's seeking to ban Anthony from trading securities without the necessary funds in his account, and force him to disclose this incident if he opens a brokerage account in the future.
Anthony couldn't immediately be reached for comment by Insider.","A pretzel-shop worker committed a $1 million fraud to buy Tesla, GameStop, and Nvidia shares - and ended up making $7,000 for his broker, SEC says",487.84,492.64001,493.54999,8,2023,30

(Reuters) - A group of engineers, researchers and a Silicon Valley-based chip company collaborated to release advanced Arabic language software that can power generative AI applications.
The new large language model called Jais contains 13 billion parameters that was made from a big batch of data combining Arabic and English, a portion of which is from computer code. The group, which included academics and engineers embarked, on the project in part because they said there are few large language models that are bilingual.
The new language model was created with the help of supercomputers produced by the Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems, which designs dinner plate-sized chips that compete with Nvidia's powerful AI hardware. Nvidia's chips are in short supply, which has driven companies around the world to seek alternatives.
Named after the highest peak in the United Arab Emirates, Jais is a collaboration between Cerebras, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate G42 called Inception, which focuses on AI.
Because there is not enough Arabic data to train a model of Jais' size, the computer code within the English language data helped train the model's ability to reason, according to Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence professor Timothy Baldwin.
""(Code) gives the model a big leg up in terms of reasoning abilities, because it spells out the (logical) steps,"" Baldwin told Reuters.
Jais will be available via an open source license.
The group trained the Jais model on a Cerebras' supercomputer called a Condor Galaxy. This year Cerebras announced it had sold three such units to G42, with the first scheduled to arrive this year and the remaining units to be delivered in 2024.

Big tech stocks powered much of the rally Tuesday. Apple rose 2.2% and Nvidia climbed 4.2%. Advancers outnumbered decliners by 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Bond yields fell broadly. Markets in Europe and Asia also rose.
The latest gains came as investors reviewed reports on consumer confidence and the labor market. The Conference Board, a business research group, reported that consumer confidence tumbled in August, surprising economists that were expecting levels to hold steady around the strong July reading. Consumer confidence and spending have been closely watched amid persistent pressure from inflation.
Also on Tuesday, the government reported that job openings fell to the lowest level since March 2021, a larger drop than economists expected. The report also showed that the number of Americans quitting their jobs fell sharply for the second-straight month, clear signs that the labor market is cooling in a way that could reduce inflation.
A strong job market has been credited as a bulwark against a recession, but it has made the Fed's mission to tame inflation more difficult. The latest data will likely be welcomed by the central bank, because fewer job openings and less quitting reduces pressure on employers to raise pay to find and keep workers.
“Markets reacted to the release of the consumer confidence and job opening reports by rallying, with both bonds and stocks up on the news as odds for a Federal Reserve rate hike at their next meeting in September fell,” said Sam Millette, fixed income strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network.
The Fed has been raising its main interest rate for more than a year to its highest level since 2001, in an effort to bring inflation back down to its 2% goal. The central bank held rates steady at its last meeting and Wall Street is betting that it will do the same at its September meeting.
Investors and economists have several more big economic reports on tap this week. The government will provide another update on the nation’s gross domestic product later Wednesday. It will also release its monthly employment report for August on Friday.
The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tracks expectations for the Fed, fell significantly after the latest consumer confidence and job openings reports. It slipped to 4.90% from about 5.03% just before the report was out. It stood at 5.05% late Monday. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell, dropping to 4.12% from 4.21% late Monday.

Wood made her name investing in disruptive innovation and bold bitcoin predictions, and when it comes to investing in AI, she and Ark Invest are all in. Speaking to Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick in an interview for “The Raz Report,” Wood said she believes that any company with “proprietary data, domain expertise in their own business, as well as AI expertise” can become more competitive.

Even though mega-cap companies like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet stand to gain even more ground in an AI world, they could be reaching market saturation levels. Wood has spoken of the need to be open to small-cap investing, and Ark Invest’s recent selling of Nvidia stock confirms that opinion.
Citing an overpriced valuation, Ark Invest has been dumping Nvidia holdings throughout the past year. In October 2022, Ark’s exchange-traded funds owned 1.3 million shares, but in May it owned just 390,000 shares after shedding a large portion at the beginning of 2023, per The Street. Following Nvidia’s remarkable latest earnings call, Wood sold another 2,230 shares worth more than $1 million.
“We believe the days of relying solely on mega-cap companies for tech innovation are waning and an era of AI-centric small-cap companies is emerging. Find out where we see potential growth opportunities built on AI,” Ark Funds tweeted last week.
Posting to X, formerly known as Twitter, at the end of May, Wood wrote, “In 2014, most investors considered $NVDA, priced at ~$5, simply a PC gaming chip stock. In contrast, @ARKInvest’s first principles research pointed to #Nvidia as the premier equity play on #AI. Now up ~80-fold, investors seem to think NVDA is the only AI play. It is not!”
What are Wood’s stock picks for an AI-dominant era? Here are three companies using AI to accelerate business, not including Tesla, which Wood still supports enthusiastically.
UiPath (PATH)
Wood is betting on the business-automation software company UiPath. Ark’s Innovation ETF (ARKK), and Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) holdings include 5.76% and 4.74% UiPath assets, respectively, and UiPath ranks in the top 10 holdings in Ark’s Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), its Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and its Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX).
“Our research suggests that other companies in this space rely too heavily on API’s that are far-removed from natural human behavior and decision making,” the company said in an investment report. “UiPath’s emphasis on low-code no-code interfaces emphasizes flexibility, scalability and ease.”
Twilio (TWLO)
Speaking about Twilio, the customer engagement and cloud communications platform provider, Ark said, “ARK has long-term conviction in Twilio and values the company’s potential to power modern enterprise-to-customer communications as mobile phone adoption grows globally.”
Earlier this month, shares of Twilio increased after it reported solid Q2 results and raised its full-year outlook. The tech company now expects annual adjusted income to be between $350 million and $400 million, per Yahoo.
MosaicML (MOS)
MosaicML is a generative AI start-up from Nervana Systems founder Naveen Rao, whose goal is to make efficient training of machine learning models more accessible. “As an AI training software layer between customers and compute resources, we believe MosaicML is likely to capture a significant share of AI compute spend,” the Ark Invest commentary stated.
Ark’s hunch has paid off. “In June, Databricks announced that it will pay $1.3 billion to acquire MosaicML, representing an approximate 5x return on this name since its addition to our Venture Fund as the first investment in September 2022,” the company reported.

NVDA,2023-08-30 15:21:25,"Nvidia is dominating the AI market, but threats are mounting. The likes of AMD are starting to counterpunch.","This article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe.
To say Nvidia (NVDA) is on fire is an understatement.
From record revenue and stunning year-over-year growth to share prices that continue to climb and the biggest tech companies on Earth breaking down its door to get access to its latest chips, Nvidia can seemingly do no wrong.
But the chip giant’s rivals, including AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), aren’t sitting idly by while it gobbles up the spoils of the AI wave.
They’re busy building out their own AI capabilities in an effort to chip away at Nvidia’s lead. Even Nvidia’s customers, including Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN), are building custom AI chips, in order to break free of their dependence on Nvidia’s products.
And while Nvidia is in no immediate danger of losing its grip on the market, Intel’s fall from the world’s most advanced chipmaker proves that there’s no guarantee the company will maintain its lead.
“Things can change pretty dramatically in this industry,” Forrester research director Glenn O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. “Intel was king of the hill and it stumbled a few years ago and really made some bad mistakes, and now they have to catch up. The same thing could happen to Nvidia.”
Rivals are hunting for their share
Nvidia is the undisputed leader of AI chips, with an estimated 80% to 95% market share, but as its competitors build out their own AI efforts, that’s all but guaranteed to decline.
“I believe on the hardware front, AMD and Intel will be able to field competitive offerings to Nvidia for both training and inference,” Moor Insights and Strategy CEO Patrick Moorhead told Yahoo Finance.
“Both companies will field very interesting offerings available in early 2024 for [large language models (LLMs)]. Even upstarts like Groq have shown advantages on certain models and workflows for LLM inference, today,” Moorhead added.
During Intel’s second quarter earnings report, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is seeing surging demand for its AI products and services, including its Gaudi line of AI chips, which will continue into next year.
“Our pipeline of opportunities through 2024 is rapidly increasing and is now over $1 billion and continuing to expand with Gaudi driving the lion’s share,” Gelsinger said during the company’s earnings call.
Intel is also in the midst of developing its next-generation AI platform called Falcon Shores, which it hopes will rival Nvidia’s and AMD’s most powerful systems. Intel initially planned for the chip to hit the market in 2024 and serve as a combined central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. Nvidia already offers a combined platform called Grace Hopper.
But Intel has since changed course and Falcon Shores will initially launch with just a GPU. The move also means the chip won’t hit the market until 2025.
AMD is a step ahead of Intel thanks to its MI300 platform. The product line, which includes a combination CPU and GPU offering called the MI300A and a GPU-only chip called the MI300X, could give AMD the kind of capabilities it needs to tackle Nvidia.
The problem? AMD didn’t announce any major customers when it announced the platform in June, according to Reuters. Still, the company and Intel are at least on course to take on Nvidia directly.
“[AMD and Intel are] not going to overcome Nvidia, certainly not anytime in the next few years,” O’Donnell said. “But can they chip away and gain some of that share? Yes, they can. And they already are doing that.”
More companies are building their own chips
Intel and AMD aren’t the only threats to Nvidia’s position at the top of the AI hardware market.
An increasing number of Big Tech firms are building their own custom AI chips. In April, The Information reported that Microsoft was working on an AI chip, and Google, Amazon, and Meta (META) have also announced their own chips.
And with their own AI platforms in hand, those companies won’t necessarily need to buy as many Nvidia chips.
“Hyperscalers [massive cloud firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google] are a measurable part of [Nvidia’s] business,” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “The biggest threat is that these big customers start to try to find their own solutions.”
But Nvidia still has a few aces up its sleeve, chief among them its software capabilities.
“I believe the hardest part of the equation is software, a moat Nvidia has built with CUDA and its libraries and workflows,” Moorhead said.
Nvidia’s CUDA is a programming model that allows developers to take advantage of its chips’ parallel processing capabilities. And it’s that software, coupled with Nvidia’s hardware, that helps give Nvidia a lead over its competitors.
Nvidia’s biggest threats, Intel and AMD, are still years off from being able to put any significant pressure on the graphics chipmaker. But Nvidia will need to continue to innovate if it hopes to stay on top in the long run.

The Roseland, New Jersey-based company, which previously specialized in ethereum mining, is working with an adviser as its management team seeks buyers for a roughly 10% equity stake at a valuation of between $5 billion and $8 billion, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing confidential talks. Terms haven’t been finalized and could still change, they added.
CoreWeave is projected to achieve about $1.5 billion in revenue in 2024, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
A CoreWeave representative declined to comment.
CoreWeave was an early adopter of Nvidia Corp. graphics chips for data centers, getting ahead of a wave that’s sweeping through technology. Some of the biggest names in the industry have realized the potential for the use of that technology in artificial intelligence training, causing a flood of orders for Nvidia, which has unveiled plans for the world’s fastest AI supercomputer.
CoreWeave is building out data centers based on Nvidia’s chips to offer artificial intelligence-related computing as a service. Earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang name-checked the company on his earnings conference call saying it’s doing “incredibly well.”
Led by Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Michael Intrator, CoreWeave has raised $421 million in equity this year, including from Nvidia, which is valued at more than $1.2 trillion. Microsoft Corp. has agreed to spend billions of dollars over several years on cloud infrastructure from CoreWeave, CNBC reported in June.
CoreWeave said earlier this month it secured $2.3 billion in debt financing led by Magnetar Capital and funds managed by Blackstone Tactical Opportunities. Coatue, DigitalBridge Credit and affiliates of BlackRock, Pimco and Carlyle also participated, the company said.

NVDA,2023-08-30 17:37:09,How much juice does Nvidia stock have after a historic year?,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This Yahoo Finance series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Up first is this year's hottest tech stock, chipmaker Nvidia.
Nvidia stock (NVDA) just hit an all-time high, and its historic year isn't over yet. But how far can the company's AI-fueled mega-growth really go?
After soaring over 230% year to date and entering the trillion-dollar club alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), the company has become the name to beat in the AI boom. And it may have more room to run, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said.
""This stock has more or less powered an entire theme of investing,"" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. ""AI as a concept is not new. ChatGPT is what made AI mainstream and brought it to a lot of laypeople’s attention. So as this gold rush started, Nvidia really fits the 'pick and shovel' metaphor.""
Nvidia's competitive moat
Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).
The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24 that stunned the broader market. Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.
Just a week ago, Nvidia once again surprised everyone with better-than-expected guidance and a new $25 billion stock buyback.
When it comes to those H100 AI chips, it’s not just hype, since Nvidia is in a class all its own — for now, at least, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said.
""They’re the only game in town in terms of AI processing right now,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""Demand and supply at some point will come into balance, but this is still a growing market.""
The company also has a solid competitive moat around the AI chip business, though it will likely get chipped away over time. The question is by how much? That will determine how high Nvidia's valuation can go over time, pros say.
The company's moat in the public cloud — in which cloud resources use a shared, public infrastructure — is especially strong and supportive of Nvidia's valuation.
""In the public cloud, it's going to be really difficult to compete with them because of the ecosystem they've built,"" Pajjuri said. ""I’m not saying Nvidia’s moat is as strong as the iPhone, but it's the strongest out there when it comes to AI, and that's especially in public cloud.""
Competition will be coming down the pike nonetheless, especially as Nvidia's offerings are expensive, and customers will inevitably look for cheaper alternatives. Having a short supply is also a key issue up for debate on the Street.
AMD (AMD) has already been moving to challenge Nvidia. Competition may even come from customers themselves as they look to build their own AI chips. And some of tech's biggest names increasingly have been moving to build their own chips in recent years, including Amazon and Apple.
What should you do with Nvidia stock?
Clearly, Nvidia stock is very hot right now.
And a cooldown in the stock isn't imminent, experts who follow Nvidia told Yahoo Finance.
""We still like the story, demand is still very strong, and supply is constrained,"" Pajjuri said.
Looking ahead, experts believe there are between two and three more quarters of sizable wins in the AI space and strong EPS growth for Nvidia.
""I still do believe fundamentals matter,"" Sosnick said. ""On one hand, I can’t think of a company that’s growing faster, but also a lot of that growth is priced in.""
At the end of the day, Wall Street overwhelmingly says buy the stock. According to Bloomberg, analysts’ recommendations currently come in at 56 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sells.

Apple spent over $600 billion on its own shares, more than Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta combined.
The quartet's outlay on buybacks exceeds the market values of Tesla, Meta, and Berkshire Hathaway.
Four Big Tech companies have plowed a combined $1 trillion into stock buybacks over the past decade, S&P Global data shows.
Apple spent an unmatched $621 billion on its own stock in the 10 years to March 31. Google-parent Alphabet ranked second with $193 billion of share repurchases over the same period. Microsoft and Meta Platforms splurged $180 billion and $130 billion respectively, the S&P Global data shows.
The tech quartet have collectively poured $1.1 trillion into buybacks since early 2013, more than the market value of Tesla ($805 billion), Berkshire Hathaway ($781 billion), or Meta ($767 billion). Their 10-year outlay also rivals Nvidia's current market capitalization of $1.2 trillion.
Other companies aren't far behind in the rankings. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JPMorgan each spent between $110 billion and $120 billion in the 10-year period. Home Depot, Berkshire, and Johnson & Johnson rounded out the top 10 with outlays of $70 billion, $77 billion, and $113 billion each.
The 20 biggest spenders have spent about $2 trillion on buybacks over the last decade — a big chunk of the $6.6 trillion deployed by S&P 500 companies as a whole in the period.
Buybacks reduce a company's total number of outstanding shares, increasing shareholders' ownership. Executives also use them to signal they believe their stock is undervalued and a good investment.
Historically, they've been more common among mature companies that are focused on returning cash to shareholders instead of growing their businesses. Technology companies tend to have better uses for their cash such as expansion, investing in new facilities and equipment, researching and developing new products, or making acquisitions.
Warren Buffett is famously a big fan of buybacks, if a company has plenty of cash to cover its operational and liquidity needs, and its stock is trading at a material discount to its intrinsic value. He's touted them as good for stockholders and stock sellers, safer than acquisitions, more efficient than dividends, and a way for executives to show they care about shareholder returns.
Indeed, Buffett's Berkshire has seen its Apple stake grow to nearly 6% in recent years without it having to spend a penny, thanks to the iPhone maker's buybacks.",4 Big Tech giants have plowed over $1 trillion into stock buybacks in 10 years - more than Tesla or Meta's entire market value,487.84,492.64001,493.54999,8,2023,30

Google and Nvidia also participated.
The tranche, which brings AI21 Labs' total raised to $283 million, values the company at $1.4 billion -- a bit higher than the figure The Information reported earlier today ($1.2 billion).
""AI21 Labs came out of stealth in October 2020 with our first launch of [AI writing tool] Wordtune,"" Yoav Shoham, one of AI21 Labs' co-CEOs, told TechCrunch via email. ""Since then, we've only managed to grow, more than doubling our workforce with plans to add even more employees.""
AI21 Labs was founded in 2017 by Shashua, Shoham and Ori Goshen, the startup's other co-CEO. Shoham, a professor emeritus at Stanford, previously sold two companies to Google, the time management app Timeful and social network friends organizer Katango. Goshen is also a serial entrepreneur, having co-founded and led several Israel-based tech companies including the telco analytics firm Crowdx.
AI21 Labs' flagship product is AI21 Studio, a pay-as-you-go developer platform for building custom text-based business apps off of AI21’s proprietary text-generating AI models -- including its cutting-edge Jurassic-2 model. The startup also sells access to the aforementioned Wordtune, a multilingual reading and writing AI assistant akin to Grammarly.
Customers can tap AI21 Labs' platform via APIs for specific generative AI use cases, like summarization, paraphrasing and grammar and spelling correction. The startup's models support a growing number of languages, including Spanish, German, Italian and Dutch.
AI21 Labs competes with a expanding roster of startups and incumbents in the red-hot generative AI space.
Google, AWS and Microsoft offer tooling comparable to AI21 Studio, as do startups like Cohere, OpenAI and Anthropic (and to a lesser extent marketing-focused vendors such as Jasper, Regie and Typeface). And AI21 Labs is at a funding disadvantage; OpenAI has raised $11.3 billion to date, while Anthropic and Cohere have raked in $1.6 billion and $435 million, respectively.
But Shoham asserts that AI21 Labs' solutions are superior in several aspects, despite looking similar on the surface and not having the benefit of a higher R&D budget.
For one, Shoham says, they're developed on ""some of the world's largest and most sophisticated large language models"" and offer ""more refined control"" than many generative AI apps on the market. Moreover, they're trained on up-to-date data, unlike text-generating models trained on older data, which can't accurately answer questions about current events.
AI21 Labs offers a range of tuning parameters to customize the output of its language models, which range from small, fast models to larger and more sophisticated offerings. Image Credits: AI21 Labs
""The AI21’s AI systems are easy to integrate and generate reliable, trustworthy and accurate results,"" Shoham said. ""The quality and quantity of training data is a huge challenge in the industry. We've worked hard to ensure that we're using up-to-date data, constantly training our models on additional data and working to ensure that the data used is reliable and trustworthy.""
Having not tested AI21 Labs' products recently, I can't speak to the veracity of those claims. But exaggerated or no, AI21 Labs appears to be gaining some traction despite its disadvantages.
Shoham -- who wouldn't reveal the size of AI21 Labs' customer base, save that it includes ""several"" Fortune 100 companies -- says that Wordtune alone has over 10 million users. And AI21 Labs was a launch partner for Bedrock, Amazon's generative AI app development platform.
Shoham says that the latest funding tranche will allow AI21 Labs to accelerate its R&D efforts and ""reach its goal of developing the next level of AI,"" with ""the capabilities of reasoning across many domains."" AI21 Labs also plans to pursue more partnerships with companies ""across the entire tech ecosystem"" and increase its 200-person headcount, with a principal focus on roles in research and business development.
AI21 Labs continues to build out its C-Suite, as well, recently hiring Pankaj Dugar, a former Google and Databricks exec, as its SVP of go-to-market and GM of North America.
It'll certainly need the money, given the capital-intensive nature of developing large language models.
According to The Information, OpenAI spent $540 million last year creating ChatGPT. And AI21 Labs’ own research pegs the expenses for training a text-generating model with 1.5 billion parameters (i.e., variables that the model uses to generate and analyze text) at as much as $1.6 million. For reference, the predecessor to AI21 Labs' Jurassic-2 model, Jurassic-1, contained 178 billion parameters.
That’s not accounting for hosting costs to serve the models.
OpenAI was at one point reportedly paying up to $700,000 a day to keep the infrastructure hosting ChatGPT up and running. Back-of-the-napkin math pegs the cost of running a model the size of GPT-3, and older OpenAI-developed model, at $87,000 per year on a service like AWS.
AWS counts AI21 Labs as a partner, so it's not clear if there's some sort of volume discounting in play. But I'd wager to say that it's not insignificant overhead.
""We've focused on growing responsibly, allowing us to continue to grow and expand, bringing our customers the most up-to-date, trustworthy AI possible,"" Shoham said.",Generative AI startup AI21 Labs lands $155M at a $1.4B valuation,487.84,492.64001,493.54999,8,2023,30

The AI boom “actually is going to maintain and you’ll see its growth keeping stronger and stronger for the upcoming years,” President Mike Yang of supplier QCT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Taiwan’s Quanta Computer Inc., told Bloomberg Television in an interview.
Quanta Computer, which works with Nvidia to build AI servers, has benefited greatly from Wall Street’s bet on the technology as the next big thing. Like its Santa Clara, California-based chipmaking partner, whose AI accelerators are the must-have hardware this year, Quanta’s share price has more than doubled in 2023.

Various component providers are working together to increase production capacity and help alleviate an ongoing shortage of Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI chips, Yang said, without committing to fulfilling all demand from customers by next year. Nvidia executives told analysts this month they were confident of expanding supply to meet heightened demand.
“We have a very much limited supply, but next year I think Nvidia will solve everything,” Yang said.
Read: Nvidia Nears Record High as AI Demand Fuels Blowout Forecast
QCT generates billions of dollars in revenue annually, with AI servers accounting for 65% of its total sales, Yang said. He differentiates AI servers as those that include graphics processors, such as models made by Nvidia, versus traditional processor-driven hardware where Intel Corp. still has a dominant share.
Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. are among QCT’s biggest customers. The company competes with the likes of Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co. and Taiwanese peer Wiwynn Corp. to provide servers for cloud service providers, mainly in the US and China.
Global shipments of AI servers are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2022 and 2026, according to Taipei-based research firm TrendForce. Analyst and researcher estimates have proven overly conservative this year, as Nvidia has in successive quarters shocked the market with blowout sales forecasts.
Yang enjoyed a moment in the spotlight in late May when Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang visited QCT’s booth at a tech expo in Taipei. Huang offered his signature leather jacket for Yang to wear during their joint marketing event. Yang said that the two companies first started working together to develop server products in 2015.
Like many other manufacturers, Yang is keeping a wary eye on the US-China trade conflict. The executive said QCT is looking to grow its production lines in the US, Germany and Thailand, while maintaining existing capacity in China, though he also said firms cannot afford to dismiss China as a major market.
“I still believe China is the biggest market,” Yang said. “I do believe people will still focus on both. China and the rest of the world.”

(Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will host tech leaders and experts at an artificial-intelligence (AI) forum on Sept. 13, as several governments around the world are considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology.
Here are some names confirmed by Schumer's office as attendees for the upcoming forum:
- Sam Altman: The CEO of ChatGPT maker OpenAI said in June he was ""quite optimistic"" about prospects for global coordination on AI.
- Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Meta has invested in artificial intelligence for years. The Facebook and Instagram owner says AI is now moving to the forefront of its business to improve content recommendations and ads across the company's services.
- Elon Musk: The CEO of Tesla launched his own AI startup named xAI earlier this year. He has referred to the potential of AI to cause ""civilization destruction."" He said after a recent trip to China that he thinks the Asian country is interested in a cooperative international framework on AI.
- Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai: Google's parent company rolled out AI products at an annual developer conference in May and revamped its search engine to include generative AI.
- Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: Earlier this year, Microsoft unveiled plans to put artificial intelligence into the hands of more users, with upgrades to its own widely used office software. The technology company previewed a new AI ""Copilot"" for Microsoft 365, its product suite that includes Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and Outlook emails.
- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: Nvidia far exceeded expectations with its quarterly revenue forecast in late August as an artificial-intelligence boom fueled demand for its chips.
- IBM CEO Arvind Krishna: IBM launched a new artificial-intelligence and data platform in May to help companies integrate AI in their business. Krishna told Bloomberg in the same month that IBM expects to pause hiring for roles as roughly 7,800 jobs could be replaced by AI in the coming years.
Other tech leaders and experts expected at the forum include billionaire Bill Gates, Motion Picture Association CEO Charles Rivkin, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Center for Humane Technology co-founder Tristan Harris, University of California, Berkeley researcher Deborah Raji and Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp, among others.

There are signs investors have become more selective as the tech rally stalled this month. Nvidia Corp.’s shares had a tepid initial reaction to results that beat lofty expectations, while Marvell Technology Inc. — another chipmaker with AI exposure — slumped after its own report. Such reactions are worrisome for the market, particularly for companies banking on a jolt from AI sales.
“There is some fatigue around the AI trade, investors are nervous about the market, and there’s less incentive to buy given uncertainty surrounding the Fed,” said Jordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities. Investor reaction to Broadcom’s outlook will be an important read on the sector, he said.
Shares of Broadcom rose 1% on Thursday.
Broadcom said last quarter that sales related to AI will double this year, and the stock’s 61% gain in 2023 has outperformed both the Philadelphia semiconductor index and the Nasdaq 100.
Delivering on that forecast would’ve likely sent the chipmaker’s shares soaring a couple weeks ago. Now, after Nvidia’s blowout fell relatively flat, Broadcom’s 10-quarter streak of rising the day after earnings could be in jeopardy. The options market is implying a one-day move of 4.4% in either direction on the day after the report.

Headwinds have been persistent. The Federal Reserve has signaled interest rates will stay higher for longer than expected, recession worries are still lingering, and multiples look elevated after a strong year-to-date advance. A basket of stocks tracked by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that are expected to benefit most from artificial intelligence has retreated from a peak at the start of the month.
“The market is enamored with AI, but people are very aware of the run-up that has occurred, and there’s a history of tech investors extrapolating growth out too quickly,” said Kevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. “The AI trade will play out over years, but we’re now assessing who is actually seeing better growth and profitability, and how attractive they look given valuations and rate policy.”
When Broadcom reports later Thursday, analysts expect revenue growth of 4.8% on net earnings growth of almost 14%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This consensus hasn’t budged over the past month, even as Nvidia’s report cemented how there continues to be massive demand for the chips used in processing AI services.
Read more: Nvidia Partner Expects AI Server Sales to Double in 2024
One mark in Broadcom’s favor is its valuation. The stock trades at 20 times estimated earnings, and while that represents a premium to its long-term average, it’s well below Nvidia at 36 or Marvell at nearly 29. It also trades at a discount to both the overall semiconductor index and the Nasdaq 100, while offering one of the higher dividend yields among chipmakers.
Furthermore, there has also been progress in the company’s $61 billion acquisition of VMware Inc., which Broadcom expects will close near the end of October.
“Broadcom is very diversified with an attractive AI business, it has good cash flow, and the valuation is more attractive, which makes it a good buy-and-hold stock as opposed to a momentum play,” Mizuho’s Klein said.
“However, it isn’t going to guide as aggressively as Nvidia, and there is a sense that if even Nvidia couldn’t rally on its forecast, what chance does any other company have.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Apple gained 1.9% on Wednesday, a rally that took the iPhone maker back above its 50-day moving average, a positive sign for short-term momentum trends. The stock fell below this closely watched level earlier this month.
Top Tech Stories
Apple Inc. is testing the use of 3D printers to produce the steel chassis used by some of its upcoming smartwatches, according to people with knowledge of the matter, heralding a major change to how the company manufactures products.
X, the social network that used to be known as Twitter, updated its privacy policy to include a new kind of user data it plans to collect: biometric.
China approved the first batch of generative artificial intelligence services for public rollout, freeing up homegrown technology champions including Baidu Inc. and SenseTime Group Inc. to openly compete with the likes of OpenAI Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
A Tesla Inc. plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials is being investigated by US prosecutors, who are looking at whether the project was an appropriate use of company funds.
Chinese state media jumped aboard a groundswell of national pride surrounding Huawei Technologies Co.’s latest smartphone, portraying the gadget as a technological marvel that delivered a much-needed victory over US sanctions.
Japan’s economy ministry is seeking a budget of more than ¥120 billion ($822 million) to strengthen the country’s semiconductor sector next year, as the nation positions chips at the core of its economic security policy.

NVDA,2023-08-31 20:56:39,Meta is an ad company that's uniquely positioned to benefit from AI.,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This Yahoo Finance series helps you decode what's happening among the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Next up is Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and a money-burning metaverse operation.
Meta (META) is an ad company.
It's a fact worth restating because while the digital ad market is also rebounding after a tough couple of years, it's also in transition amid the AI boom.
This means that Meta's rhetoric and efforts around AI aren't just posturing — they're existentially important to the company's future. If not from AI, it's not entirely clear where the next phase of growth for Meta comes from.
""The argument I've made is that there's an AI product cycle that's taking place for Meta,"" JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone told Yahoo Finance. If you're Meta, ""you have a better understanding of contracts, and you do a better job of recommending engaging content to users.""
Meta faces tough AI, regulatory landscape
Meta stock has had a tremendous run so far in 2023, rising over 145% year to date. But at $295.89 it's still well below its all-time high of $382.12 on Sept. 7, 2021.
Optimizing AI in its advertising offerings may be the next catalyst that gets Meta back to its highs.
""What will help Meta stay ahead is AI,"" Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, told Yahoo Finance. ""It's critical for the company to emerge as a leader in the next generation of digital advertising: AI-enhanced advertising. ... Meta has a growing array of competitors in the fast-moving AI landscape and it must work quickly to stay ahead.""
However, there are regulatory concerns for Meta, especially from European regulators.
The last thing Meta needs is anything new that will shake up Meta's business model the way Apple's (AAPL) App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework did in 2021. When it was first launched, ATT was devastating to social media businesses, including Meta's, as it allowed users to opt out of identifiers for advertisers, or IDFAs, which are the device IDs underlying Apple's framework.
""The concern is not the FTC, but the DSA [Europe's Digital Services Act],"" said Boone, adding that ""the nightmare scenario is another version of the IDFA.""
Williamson agreed, citing concerns around Meta's ability to operate under increasingly active European regulation.
""The DSA will fundamentally change Facebook, Instagram, and other popular platforms,"" she said. ""They must alter their business practices to comply with the restrictions; if they don’t, they will face fines or bans in the region.""
What should you do with Meta stock?
The consensus seems to be that Meta still has a lot of room to run and has the ability to get back to those highs.
Currently, Wall Street analyst recommendations for Meta shake out to 59 Buys, seven Holds, and two Sells.
""We believe the stock could see renewed enthusiasm on 2024 upside potential once Street has greater certainty on 2024 spending targets (usually provided with 3Q earnings),"" Justin Post and Nitin Bansal, analysts at Bank of America, recently wrote.
Even though it's not the AI company everyone's talking about, Meta seems positioned for some upside — barring regulatory nightmares.

Strong AI demand and IT spending should be able to power the sector higher through the next year.
Nvidia's latest earnings report in particular was a ""drop the mic"" moment, Wedbush added.
The new bull market for tech stocks is here, as Wall Street's excitement for artificial intelligence means money is pouring into the sector, according to Wedbush analysts.
""We believe key solid results/guidance last night from the likes of tech stalwarts Salesforce, Okta, and Crowdstrike reinforce our thesis that a modestly improving IT spending environment on the heels of this '1995-like AI Revolution' creates a bullish set up for tech stocks into year-end and 2024,"" Wedbush analysts said a note on Thursday. ""We believe tech stocks rip higher into year-end with the new tech bull market here.""
Nvidia's latest earnings report in particular was a ""drop the mic"" moment, Wedbush added. The chipmaker's success should show investors that the demand for AI will be as strong as other revolutionary tech trends.
In addition to comparing AI to the early years of the internet, analysts also likened it to the advent of Apple's first iPhone in 2007.
A handful of investors have stayed bearish on the market, given the array of macro pressures that are currently beating down on stocks. Inflationary pressures could still be lingering in the economy, and the Fed has signaled it could continue to hike interest rates to tame high prices, a move that will weigh on equities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Arm Holdings Ltd plans to launch its roadshow for investors after Labor Day, as the chip designer prepares for its much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) in September, according to people familiar with the matter.
Arm, owned by SoftBank Group Corp, is expected to set a price range for its offering next week, the sources said, adding the company plans to price its shares on Sept. 13, with stock trading to start the following day.
SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of Arm's shares in the IPO at a valuation of $60 billion to $70 billion, Reuters has previously reported. SoftBank decided to sell fewer Arm shares in the IPO after buying the 25% stake in Arm it did not directly own from its Vision Fund unit.
Several customers of Arm have held talks about taking a piece of the IPO including Apple, Amazon.com, Intel, Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics and TSMC, Reuters has previously reported. Arm and SoftBank have set aside 10% of the shares to be sold in the IPO for its clients.
A successful IPO for Arm would be a boon for SoftBank, which in August reported its third consecutive quarterly loss, hit by declines in valuations of major holdings such as Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group, German telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom and U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile U.S..
Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Mizuho Financial Group are the lead underwriters for the offering. Arm's shares will be listed on the Nasdaq and trade under the ticker symbol 'ARM'.
Bloomberg reported on Arm's IPO timeline earlier on Thursday.

South Korea’s largest electronics firm will begin supplying HBM3 — a newer generation of memory optimized to work with artificial intelligence accelerators — from the fourth quarter, Citigroup analysts including Peter Lee wrote in a report. Its shares gained their most since January 2021. Arch-foe SK Hynix Inc. has so far been Nvidia’s sole provider of high-bandwidth memory for AI accelerators.
“Following its successful entrance into Nvidia’s HBM supply chain, we foresee Samsung to emerge as one of the major suppliers of HBM3,” Lee and Josh Yang wrote in a report raising Citigroup’s price target for Samsung to 120,000 won from 110,000 won. “We see Samsung as a long-term beneficiary of memory and AI computing market growth.”
Samsung clinched the deal to supply Nvidia with HBM3 when its chips passed the final quality test by the US chip designer, Korea Economic Daily reported on Friday, citing unnamed industry sources. The report said Samsung will start its supply of the key memory chips as early as next month.
Nvidia would benefit from having Samsung as an additional supplier of HBM3. The Santa Clara, California-based company, whose shares have rallied threefold this year to a market value of $1.2 trillion, could see better costs or performance and more stable supply as it expands its options.
A Samsung spokesperson declined to comment.
Suppliers to Samsung also traded higher on the news, with Hana Micron Inc., a chip testing and packaging firm, jumping by the daily limit of 30%. Daeduck Electronics Co., a printed circuit board supplier, rose 7.4%.
Hynix is the global leader in HBM3, which experts regard as ideal for bandwidth-hungry AI services. Samsung has said it plans to launch a new HBM chip later this year. Hynix shares fell 1.5% after rising earlier in Friday’s session.

Broadcom was expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, behind trailblazer Nvidia, but the company's exposure to sluggish segments such as smartphones, telecoms gear and non-AI servers is impeding growth.
""Off the back of Nvidia's blowout earnings update, anything less than stellar is being seen as disappointing,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.
Apart from its generative AI gains, Broadcom's semiconductor business growth stalled in the third quarter and the same is expected for the fourth quarter, with a tough economy pressuring enterprise spending and as clients redirect their dollars to expensive AI gear from traditional computing hardware.
""Broadcom is more exposed to items like smartphones, where demand is slower and less linked to the mega-growth story of AI,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates.
Still, Broadcom's AI star looks to be on the rise.
The company, which supplies chips that help glue together AI supercomputers and traditional servers, expects networking revenue to jump 20% in the fourth quarter.
Also, at least 7 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, lauding the company's strong execution on its AI business.
Its stock has added more than $150 billion in market value so far this year.

The investors also include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Cadence Design Systems Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Synopsys Inc., among others, said the people, who asked not to identified because the details haven’t been announced. SoftBank has been in discussions with Arm customers and partners for months, but the plans are just being finalized now. Still, the specifics could change as the company gets closer to the IPO, which is expected to have its investor roadshow underway by next week.
The investors will put in amounts ranging from $25 million to $100 million, according to the people.
The show of support from some of the tech industry’s biggest names will help bolster the offering, which is expected to raise $5 billion to $7 billion. SoftBank, which acquired Arm in 2016, was previously aiming to value the chip business at $60 billion to $70 billion, but the figure could be more in the range of $50 billion to $60 billion, Bloomberg has reported.
Representatives from AMD, Arm, Google, Nvidia and Synopsys declined to comment. Apple, Cadence, Intel and Samsung didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
SoftBank is capitalizing on investor interest in the chip industry, which has benefited from spending on artificial intelligence equipment. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rallied this year, far outpacing the S&P 500 Index and other major indexes.
Arm provides chip designs and licenses technology that’s a crucial part of the more than 1 billion smartphones sold every year. In recent years, it has tried to spread its reach into new areas, including computers used in data centers, seeking to be part of higher-priced electronic components.
Arm is considering pricing its shares on Sept. 13, and the stock will start trading the next day, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. The roadshow to promote the offering is expected to come after the US Labor Day holiday on Monday.
Initially, Arm was looking to raise $8 billion to $10 billion, but the target was lowered after owner SoftBank decided to hold on to more of the company — a move that involved buying Vision Fund’s stake in the chip designer. That transaction valued the chip company at more than $64 billion.
A successful debut by Arm would be a boon for SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son, whose Vision Fund lost a record $30 billion last year. It could also spur dozens of companies to pursue their own IPO plans. Online grocery-delivery firm Instacart Inc., marketing and data automation provider Klaviyo and footwear maker Birkenstock are all working on their own offerings.
Son doesn’t want to part with more than 10% of the company at this point, Bloomberg has reported.
Arm, based in Cambridge, England, has assembled a lengthly roster of underwriters for the IPO, reflecting both the company’s global reach and banks’ eagerness to land roles on big-ticket deals in a slow listings market. Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mizuho Financial Group are leading the offering.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Customers of Arm Holdings Ltd including Apple Inc, Nvidia Corp, Alphabet Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc have agreed to invest in the chip designer's initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.
Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Cadence Design Systems Inc and Synopsys Inc have also agreed to participate as investors in the offering, the sources added. The talks are ongoing and some other potential investors are also in discussions to invest in the IPO, the sources added.
SoftBank Group Corp, which owns Britain-based Arm, is targeting a valuation between $50 billion and $55 billion, Reuters reported earlier on Friday. Arm's clients have agreed to invest in that valuation range, the sources said.
While it is possible that demand for Arm's shares will lead to a higher valuation by the time the IPO prices, the move represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank acquired the 25% stake in the company it did not already own from its $100 billion Vision Fund last month.
Apple, Nvidia and the other strategic investors have agreed to invest between $25 million and $100 million each in the blockbuster IPO, the sources said. Arm and SoftBank have set aside 10% of the shares to be sold in the IPO for its clients, Reuters has previously reported.
Amazon.com Inc, which had previously held talks to invest in the IPO, has decided not to participate, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.
A scramble among Arm's clients, comprising the world's biggest technology companies, to snap up shares in the IPO is testing the semiconductor designer's adherence to not picking sides in the chip industry.
The interest is fueled by a desire by companies to expand their commercial relationship with Arm and make sure rivals do not gain an edge, Reuters has previously reported.
While an investment in the IPO would not come with a seat on Arm's board or ability to dictate strategy, it could strengthen ties with each participating company and make it harder for a competitor to acquire Arm later.
Arm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
AMD, Intel, Synopsys and Nvidia declined to comment. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Cadence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Arm's valuation target earlier on Friday.

Sept 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday as higher Treasury yields weighed on growth stocks, while a slow pace of expansion in services activity in China stoked worries over demand in the world's second largest economy.

Futures on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.1%, while those on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) were broadly unchanged, both paring earlier deeper losses. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slid 0.3%, as climbing 10-year Treasury yields weighed on growth stocks.
Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) slipped ahead of the reopen of trading after the Labor Day holiday.
The three major gauges are coming off a winning week that saw the S&P 500 book its best weekly performance since June, as a stream of economic updates fed hopes the Federal Reserve would hold off from hiking interest rates at its September meeting.
Data out Tuesday showed China’s services activity fell to its lowest level in eight months in August, reviving worries about recovery in the world's second-biggest economy — and what that means for demand globally.
Amid the downturn debate, analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their odds of a US recession, given cooling inflation and a still-resilient labor market. Plus, they played down the idea that a long drag from the Fed's rate-hiking campaign will push the economy into a severe slowdown.
With a light earnings and economic calendar ahead, the focus will likely stay on the Fed this week, when investors looking at seasonal forces in play for stocks may well find fewer reasons to be cheerful. September has historically been a downbeat month for markets.
That said, some analysts believe September may not be as bad as expected, pointing to factors such as excitement around AI, cash on the sidelines, and Apple's rumored new iPhone release.

SoftBank is offering 95.5 million American depository shares of the Cambridge, UK-based company for $47 to $51 apiece and aims to raise up to $4.87 billion at the top of the range, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.
The Japanese conglomerate's recent deal to acquire the 25% stake in Arm that it did not already own from its Vision Fund unit had valued the chip designer at $64 billion.
SoftBank will own 90.6% of Arm's ordinary shares after the offering closes, it said in a filing.
Arm's return to the public markets will be a milestone for SoftBank, as it taps several marquee technology names as investors in the company whose designs power more than 99% of the world's smartphones.
The listing is expected to buoy the IPO market globally and fuel other startups to move ahead with their offerings as Arm's success signals the return of investor appetite for high-growth technology companies.
Reuters first reported on SoftBank's proposed price range for the IPO on Saturday. Sources also said it could possibly raise this range before the IPO prices, should investor demand prove strong.
Arm has signed up many of its major clients as investors in its IPO, including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Samsung Electronics.
SoftBank's current range reflects a drop in valuation for Arm from last month's Vision Fund deal, but the interest in the IPO remains robust, fueled by a desire of its clients to expand their commercial relationship with Arm and make sure rivals do not gain an edge.
Arm's client roster includes the world's biggest tech giants. It generates a big share of its revenue through royalty fees, based on either the average selling price of the customer's Arm-based chip or a fixed fee per chip.
For the year ended March 31, Arm's sales fell to $2.68 billion, hurt mainly by a slump in global smartphone shipments.
Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Mizuho Financial Group are the lead underwriters for the offering.

So says Rob Arnott, renowned for his warnings on the dangers of bloated megacaps — and the designer of passive products for muting their supposed threat. Up 228% in 2023, Nvidia may be riding a revolution in computer science, but the stock is “a textbook story of a Big Market Delusion,” wrote the founder of Research Affiliates LLC.
“Overconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,” Arnott wrote in a new research note, citing shares trading at around 110 times earnings. “Nvidia is today’s exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection.”
Would Nvidia’s popping bring down the whole market? “It’s very possible,” Arnott said in an interview.
Shares of Nvidia fell 1.1% on Tuesday.
Strong opinions about alleged bubbles are nothing new for Arnott, an architect of the so-called smart-beta system of rewiring traditional indexes in ways that limit the influence of giant companies. He predicted in December 2020 that Tesla Inc. would be a drag on the S&P 500 after it became the biggest company ever added to the benchmark. The stock and the index are both up about 20% since he made that case.
Warnings about valuations have rained down on the Nasdaq 100 since long before Apple Inc. became the first trillion-dollar US company five years ago. The index has returned nearly 15% annually since 2008. And virtually every effort to beat the main exchange-traded fund tracking the index has failed.
Only one actively managed stock mutual fund in the US has managed to outperform the Nasdaq Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (ticker QQQ) over the past five, 10 and 15 years, a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis by David Cohne found. It did so thanks largely to a heavy concentration in Tesla.
“You don’t want to be in a situation at this point where you’re betting against continued US innovation and the impacts that can have on the economy,” said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager and head of multi-asset solutions at Federated Hermes. “These companies, they’ve got more cash than God. So there’s a resiliency there, there’s balance sheets there that are altogether different than what you had a couple of generations ago.”
Arnott says he’s not opposed to capitalization-weighted indexing, in which a company’s representation in an index is based on its market value. “If you just want to own the market, sure, cap-weighting is fine. But there are issues — and the most flagrant issue is that anything that is today overpriced relative to its future prospects is overweight in your portfolio,” he said.
Following the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000, the average stock in the S&P 500 rose by 25% over the next two years, while a cap-weighted index dominated by tech stocks fell by 21%. Arnott points to the list of tech firms that were the top 10 most-valuable at the peak of the dot-com bubble. None were able to beat the market by the time the next bull run peaked in 2007, and only Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. are ahead today, two decades later.
The tech behemoths that have powered the Nasdaq 100 rally have been standouts for years as they became beneficiaries of scalable business models that allowed them to generate strong earnings and cash-heavy balance sheets. They look “fantastic” when viewed over specific time periods, including since 2014, when they really started to take off. “If you cherry pick right now, you can’t beat the Qs.”
But bullish sentiment toward Nvidia — which leads the market in artificial-intelligence processors — reflects too much certainty that its products won’t be displaced by competitors, he says.
Many investors are buying it with the assumption that its size — at roughly $1.2 trillion — makes it a “safe play.” But it’s not “too big to fail,” it’s “too big to succeed,” according to Arnott.
“The risk that we’re wrong, that Nvidia’s off to incredible things and will go up another 10-fold in the coming 10 years is possible,” he said. “I would say it’s not plausible, and therefore I’m comfortable calling it a bubble.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Palantir Technologies Inc. fell 25% in August, its biggest monthly drop in a year, as analysts continued to turn bearish on the stock. Morgan Stanley downgraded its recommendation on the data-analysis software company’s shares, saying its valuation reflects “AI euphoria,” but that any tailwind from this trend will take time to materialize.

NVDA,2023-09-05 16:42:30,Arm is cutting back the size of its hotly anticipated New York listing as investors value the British microchip designer well below its Japanese owner’s previous expectations.,"Arm is cutting back the size of its hotly anticipated New York listing as investors value the British microchip designer well below its Japanese owner’s previous expectations.
SoftBank, Arm’s owner, will sell between $4.4bn and $4.9bn (£3.5bn and £3.9bn) worth of shares when it floats on the Nasdaq next week, Arm said.
This is well below the $8bn to $10bn that had been expected, although it would still make the flotation the biggest of the year so far.
Arm has faced questions over growth and its reliance on its troublesome Chinese division since filing to go public two weeks ago.
In an updated filing on Tuesday, Arm said it expected to sell shares at between $47 and $51, which would value the company at between $48bn and $52bn.
This is well below the $64bn valuation at which SoftBank valued Arm in a deal with its separate Vision Fund last month, and less than the $70bn that bankers had hoped for.
The listing is being closely watched because investors hope it will breathe life into a dormant IPO market and boost confidence in the tech sector, which has suffered from falling valuations for the last year.
As part of the flotation, a slew of tech giants including Apple, Google, Samsung and Nvidia will buy up to $735m worth of shares. Other companies investing in the listing include Taiwanese chip giants Mediatek and TSMC, chipmakers Intel and AMD, and semiconductor design companies Synopsys and Cadence.
Amazon and the US chipmaker Qualcomm, which had both been rumoured as possible investors, are not participating.
The investors, which are major customers of the British company, are likely to be long-term investors, although Arm said the purchases would not grant them any additional rights.
A slew of banks are also underwriting the deal.
The reduced size of the offering is a blow to Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive and Arm’s chairman, who is hoping that a successful listing will make up for a string of disappointing tech investments.
SoftBank paid £24bn to buy the Cambridge-based company in 2016, and is seeking a healthy profit on the purchase amid investor hype over the AI boom that has driven US chip company Nvidia to a $1.2 trillion valuation.
It will remain Arm’s dominant shareholder immediately after the flotation, with around 90.6pc of shares, and be prevented from selling further shares until 180 days after the listing.
Arm opted to float in New York despite a concerted effort from Rishi Sunak to encourage the company to return to the London Stock Exchange, in part because tech companies are seen as securing much higher valuations in the US.
Arm’s semiconductor designs are used in 99pc of the world’s smartphones and the company says 70pc of the world’s population uses its technology, but investors have raised questions about its growth potential.
Its revenue fell slightly last year, and the company is seen as exposed to a microchip trade war between the US and China. China accounted for 24pc of Arm’s sales last year and its Chinese entity operates independently, a fact the company has said exposes it to “significant risks”.
The company is embarking on an investor roadshow over the coming days before settling on a final price and going public next week.",British chipmaker Arm to cut valuation ahead of US listing,485.09,485.48001,470.60999,9,2023,5

United Airlines Resumes US Flights After Temporary Grounding on Tech Issue
The Cambridge-based company, which snubbed the London Stock Exchange earlier this year, is aiming for a market value of close to $55 billion, based on calculations from filings released on Tuesday. That’s well below initial reports of a target of up to $70 billion.
“It’s a lot more challenging for Arm to capitalize on the current trend for AI than a company like Nvidia,” said Albie Amankona, analyst at Third Bridge. That’s because a big chunk of Arm’s revenues are derived from mobile, while the AI market is centered around cloud-based operations, he said.
The lowered value is a letdown to Softbank’s Masayoshi Son, who sought to flourish in the era of artificial intelligence computing that has helped Nvidia Corp. scale a $1.2 trillion market capitalization after the stock’s 231% jump this year. Arm is also facing risks from an economic slowdown in China, which accounted for a quarter of its sales in the year ended March.
The company could still raise more or less money depending on investor demand on its roadshow. After the IPO, SoftBank will still control about 90% of Arm’s shares.
However, choosing New York for its IPO over London — where it used to trade before Softbank’s takeover in 2016 — was not a surprise. The UK’s troubled equity market has failed to attract any significant tech listings since Wise Plc and Deliveroo Plc in 2021, and both stocks have struggled since their market debut.
“UK tech is such a small part of global tech industry that they had little choice than going to the US,” said Neil Campling, a founding partner at hedge fund Chameleon Global Cap. However, the move did little to help on the valuation front, he said.

NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Arm Holdings Ltd, the chip designer owned by SoftBank Group Corp, began its marketing road show for its blockbuster initial public offering on Tuesday in Baltimore, where T. Rowe Price is headquartered, underscoring the fund manager's significance as a potential investor.
Arm is also meeting with other potential investors, including Arlington, Virginia-based Sands Capital, in Baltimore on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter.
The chip designer is expected to meet with other investors in cities including New York in the days leading up to the pricing of its IPO on Sept. 13, the sources said.
Arm declined to comment. T. Rowe Price and Sands Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Earlier on Tuesday, Arm said it would seek to raise about $4.9 billion at a valuation of more than $52 billion from its IPO, which is expected to be the biggest stock market flotation of the year.
Arm has signed up many of its major clients as investors in its IPO, including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet , Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Samsung Electronics.
Arm has said that cornerstone investors have separately indicated an interest in buying a combined $735 million of the American Depositary Shares (ADS) being sold.

NVDA,2023-09-05 20:56:24,"According to Nvidia, $600 billion is tied to a major bet on accelerated computing.","Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference on Tuesday, Nvidia (NVDA) exec Manuvir Das outlined some startling numbers on the market for artificial intelligence.
According to Das, the total addressable market for AI will consist of $300 billion in chips and systems, $150 billion in generative AI software, and $150 billion in omniverse enterprise software. These figures represent growth over the ""long term,"" Das said, though he did not specify a target date.
The grand total adds up to a $600 billion AI-fueled market opportunity that is tied to what Nvidia calls ""accelerated computing.""
""It's not just about the chips, it's about the whole stack,"" said Das, Nvidia's vice president of enterprise computing.
Despite the recent boom in AI since last November, Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar said that the value of AI has been building for years.
""It's not a new thing,"" Friar told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi at the Communacopia conference. ""ChatGPT unleashed generative AI and really brought it in, I think, to the cultural domain. But of course, we've all been investing in data for now decades, and we're starting to see it come to fruition.""
Still, Das explained that when it comes to accelerated computing, the industry is still in its early stages.
""If you think about the traditional computing systems based on CPU computing, what has changed over the decades is simply the location — you're in the cloud, you're doing it on your phone, but it's essentially the same style of computing,"" Das told the audience. ""And more and more, the functions of companies are being done in computing. That means you need more and more computing in the world, which means you need more data centers. You need more energy. You need more horsepower, and it's just not sustainable.""
The way Das described it, Nvidia is capitalizing on an inevitability the company has been preparing for, in which corporate operations go digital and grow more efficient in previously unimaginable ways.
""It's time to start on a more sustainable trajectory,"" Das added. ""We're saying [with] accelerated computing, which is with the same footprint, we can do 10 times, 100 times the work — that's going to be the only way.""
Investors seem to agree. Nvidia stock has soared 232% to all-time highs this year, powered by blowout earnings and its pole position in the AI space.
""The simplest way of thinking about Nvidia is that we made this big bet,"" Das said. ""It's been decades in the making.""

NVDA,2023-09-06 01:25:34,"The Softbank-owned chip firm has also drawn interest from Samsung, Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices in what could mark a revival of the IPO market.","Softbank Group-owned chip designer Arm is targeting a $52 billion IPO in September.
The launch is set to draw big investment from tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Samsung, and Google.
The debut is expected to be the largest of 2023, and it could mark a turning point for the sluggish IPO market.
Arm, the Softbank Group-owned chip designer, could see a valuation as high as $52 billion in its initial public offering on Nasdaq, according to an updated filing Tuesday.
Softbank will offer 95.5 million American depository shares, and will target a sale price of $47-$51 per share for about 10% of the total shares outstanding.
The company is looking to raise up to $4.87 billion, but even on the lower range, it's set to be the biggest US IPO of the year. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, people close to the deal say they expect strong demand during the run-up to the IPO could push the price higher.
Not since Rivian in late 2021 has another company come close to this size in its public-market debut.
The British company, which designs chips used in most of the world's smartphones, was previously listed in both London and New York before Softbank's acquisition in 2016 for $32 billion. The new target valuation is lower than the $64 billion last month at which Softbank took over a 25% stake from its own Vision Fund, the Saudi-backed investment arm it manages.
After going public, Softbank will retain control of about 90% of Arm's shares, the filing showed.
Final pricing as well as its trading debut on the Nasdaq exchange is set for next week. It will list under the symbol ""ARM.""
A-list tech titans want in
Arm's roster of IPO investors include a handful of the world's most recognizable names in tech, and they are poised to scoop up a total of $735 million in stock for the IPO. Samsung, Google, Apple, Nvidia, and Intel are among those that could participate as ""cornerstone investors,"" the Tuesday filing said.
Other top investors include TSMC and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as other chip names MediaTek, Cadence, and Synopsys.
The wave of big-name interest suggests Wall Street and industry leaders have high hopes for Arm in the fast-budding artificial intelligence market that this year helped propel chip giant Nvidia to a trillion-dollar market cap and sent tech shares soaring on a wave of enthusiasm around the budding technology.
Lead underwriters for Arm's IPO include Goldman Sachs, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, and Mizuho Financial Group.
A revival of IPOs
It's possible that the blockbuster stock launch marks a turning point for what's been a relatively muted IPO market since 2022. Arm could help pave the way for other tech firms and startups who's plans for an IPO have stalled through the downturn.
Bloomberg data shows that the US IPO market has been in its deepest trough since 2009, with a historically-low number of companies going public on domestic exchanges since March of last year.
""On the heels of what has arguably been the slowest IPO market in 20 years, investors are hungry for new ideas and VCs are getting impatient,"" Rob Wotczak, chief executive of boutique investment bank Freedom Capital Markets, told Insider. ""We see evidence of this in the increased number, and nature, of calls we are receiving and the type of due diligence we are currently undertaking.""
As for Softbank, the IPO gives it a chance to gradually sell down its position in Arm, and any early momentum from the stock launch could provide fresh capital for separate investments in up-and-coming AI companies. In a sign of the huge interest in that space, The Information reported that AI startups comprised over 60% of Y Combinator's latest class of early-stage companies.
Plus, should Arm's trading debut prove successful, it could furnish Softbank founder Masayoshi Son with profits to cushion last year's $30 billion in losses in its Vision Fund.
""We are aware that a good number of companies have been waiting on the sidelines and we expect that, all things being equal, Instacart will also test the market later this month,"" Wotczak said. ""Other high-profile companies, like Stripe and DataBricks, will be watching closely and so we believe that getting Arm successfully out of the IPO gate could proof the market for these players.""",Arm is headed for a $52 billion IPO that's set to draw tech titans like Apple and Nvidia.

NVDA,2023-09-06 01:27:31,Arm's blockbuster IPO will be a litmus test of the market after inflation and interest rate hikes have made investors hesitant.,"In a season of sparse initial public offerings (IPOs), the public debut of the chip designer Arm will be a litmus test of the market after inflation and interest rate increases have made investors hesitant.
Arm, a provider of chip technology owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (SFTBF), started their IPO roadshow after filing an amended F-1 with the SEC today (Sept. 5) . The company is offering 95.5 million shares priced at $47 to $51 apiece, which would give it a valuation between $50.2 billion and $54.5 billion, making it the largest IPO since the electric carmaker Rivian’s public debut in 2021.
SoftBank acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016 and will still own roughly 90 percent of the company after it goes public, as stated in today’s F-1 filing. Arm shares are expected to begin trading on Nasdaq next week under the ticker symbol ARM.
Arm primarily designs and sells the intellectual property rights to their ARM CPUs, which are almost ubiquitously found in all manner of smartphones, computers and smart televisions. Arm also sells IP rights to their own line of GPUs, and has said it plans to incorporate artificial intelligence technologies into their chip designs.
Several tech giants, including Alphabet, Apple, Samsung and Nvidia, have already agreed to invest significantly once the company goes public. If Arm’s IPO sees great success, it may signal investors are opening up to technology companies again and encourage more IPOs to enter the market.
While Arm’s commitment to A.I. may excite investors as the technology develops, there is some speculation on how much it will benefit Arm. Sara Russo, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a letter to clients that, while Arm is in a good position to benefit from A.I., little evidence has been provided as to how A.I. will impact sales.
For the fiscal year ended March, Arm reported a revenue of $2.68 billion, down roughly 1 percent from the previous fiscal year. Arm attributed the revenue decrease to supply shortages for smartphones and computer chips due to Covid. If world events cause such a shortage again, Arm may not see as much growth as anticipated.

If you want to skip our coverage of the current economic environment, then take a look at 5 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy.
When compared to the optimism that surrounded stocks earlier this year after a strong run during the first half of 2023, the second half is relatively quieter. As opposed to the remainder of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking sector and artificial intelligence that dominated sentiment in H1, the second half is different. With weeks left until the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates by 25 basis points again or keep them at current levels, questions about the state of the economy and the duration of high interest rates are key questions that could determine where markets are heading moving forward.
Talking about valuation, one of the biggest stocks this year has been the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up 238% year to date, effectively more than doubling any investment made earlier this year. Much of NVIDIA's valuation is based on the revenues that the market expects it to capture in an enterprise computing market shifting towards artificial intelligence. The market believes that NVIDIA can grow its earnings by quite a lot because of superior products for the budding AI market, but there are some quarters that speculate that the firm could be overvalued. Overvaluation is when the share price of a firm is significantly higher than its ability to earn revenue and generate a profit. Chip firms are typically valued at 54 times their earnings, and this has been pushed up by the recent downturn in the chip sector that has led to earnings drops as manufacturers struggle between balancing revenue and keeping costs low. NVIDIA's trailing P/E ratio is 117, helped by the massive increase in its share price.
The main measure through which a stock is evaluated for its value is the price to earnings ratio. This determines whether a stock is expensive or cheap, and profitable companies that have low share prices respective to their earnings are often considered cheap. However, these categorizations of value shift when a firm is analyzed and compared with its industry peers. Different industries have different price to earnings ratios, and a firm can be cheap when compared to its peers but expensive in relation to other companies in different sectors or industries. Companies with low P/E ratios typically operate in mature sectors or have mature business models that are unlikely to aggressively pursue market share. On the flip side, for companies in growing sectors such as technology and electric vehicles, the ratio is higher as investors start to factor in future growth potential in the current price.
Cautionary voices warning about overvalued stocks were quite common as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ soared earlier this year, as some investors were wary that share prices were higher simply due to market euphoria about falling inflation and a robust economy. By the end of June, the S&P500 was trading at 19 times its forward earnings, which is higher than the 15.6 historical average, leading Goldman Sachs to speculate that a draw down can come into play now if we take history as an example. This sentiment was echoed by Wells Fargo, which downgraded the technology sector to Neutral. A similar trend was present in the NASDAQ 100, which had been one of the best performing stock indexes this year. The NASDAQ was trading at 27 times price to forward earnings, also higher than the 19.3 times historical average.
With the backdrop of lofty valuations in play, it appears that investor sentiment is shifting toward short term economic performance as well. U.S. non farm unemployment stood at 3.8% in August, leading some to worry that perhaps the economy might be slowing down a bit too much. Others believe that the higher unemployment is due to more labor market participation, and the economy is likely to see a soft landing rather than a recession in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hiking cycle.
Considering that valuations are quite important these days, we decided to take a look at some dirt cheap stocks to buy. The stocks that top this list are W&T Offshore, Inc. (NYSE:WTI), Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE:CYH), and Baytex Energy Corp. (NYSE:BTE).

If you want to skip our coverage of the current economic environment, then take a look at 5 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy.
When compared to the optimism that surrounded stocks earlier this year after a strong run during the first half of 2023, the second half is relatively quieter. As opposed to the remainder of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking sector and artificial intelligence that dominated sentiment in H1, the second half is different. With weeks left until the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates by 25 basis points again or keep them at current levels, questions about the state of the economy and the duration of high interest rates are key questions that could determine where markets are heading moving forward.
Talking about valuation, one of the biggest stocks this year has been the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up 238% year to date, effectively more than doubling any investment made earlier this year. Much of NVIDIA's valuation is based on the revenues that the market expects it to capture in an enterprise computing market shifting towards artificial intelligence. The market believes that NVIDIA can grow its earnings by quite a lot because of superior products for the budding AI market, but there are some quarters that speculate that the firm could be overvalued. Overvaluation is when the share price of a firm is significantly higher than its ability to earn revenue and generate a profit. Chip firms are typically valued at 54 times their earnings, and this has been pushed up by the recent downturn in the chip sector that has led to earnings drops as manufacturers struggle between balancing revenue and keeping costs low. NVIDIA's trailing P/E ratio is 117, helped by the massive increase in its share price.
The main measure through which a stock is evaluated for its value is the price to earnings ratio. This determines whether a stock is expensive or cheap, and profitable companies that have low share prices respective to their earnings are often considered cheap. However, these categorizations of value shift when a firm is analyzed and compared with its industry peers. Different industries have different price to earnings ratios, and a firm can be cheap when compared to its peers but expensive in relation to other companies in different sectors or industries. Companies with low P/E ratios typically operate in mature sectors or have mature business models that are unlikely to aggressively pursue market share. On the flip side, for companies in growing sectors such as technology and electric vehicles, the ratio is higher as investors start to factor in future growth potential in the current price.
Cautionary voices warning about overvalued stocks were quite common as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ soared earlier this year, as some investors were wary that share prices were higher simply due to market euphoria about falling inflation and a robust economy. By the end of June, the S&P500 was trading at 19 times its forward earnings, which is higher than the 15.6 historical average, leading Goldman Sachs to speculate that a draw down can come into play now if we take history as an example. This sentiment was echoed by Wells Fargo, which downgraded the technology sector to Neutral. A similar trend was present in the NASDAQ 100, which had been one of the best performing stock indexes this year. The NASDAQ was trading at 27 times price to forward earnings, also higher than the 19.3 times historical average.
With the backdrop of lofty valuations in play, it appears that investor sentiment is shifting toward short term economic performance as well. U.S. non farm unemployment stood at 3.8% in August, leading some to worry that perhaps the economy might be slowing down a bit too much. Others believe that the higher unemployment is due to more labor market participation, and the economy is likely to see a soft landing rather than a recession in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hiking cycle.
Considering that valuations are quite important these days, we decided to take a look at some dirt cheap stocks to buy. The stocks that top this list are W&T Offshore, Inc. (NYSE:WTI), Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE:CYH), and Baytex Energy Corp. (NYSE:BTE).

He classed the chipmaker company as a ""textbook story of a Big Market Delusion"" due to its sky-high valuation.
""Would Nvidia's popping bring down the whole market? ""It's very possible,"" Arnott said.
Nvidia's stocks have formed an asset bubble following this year's stunning rally — and should it pop, that could trigger a broader market crash, investing legend Rob Arnott says.
The Research Affiliates founder classed the semiconductor stock, which more than tripled in value this year thanks to AI hype, as a ""textbook story of a Big Market Delusion,"" Bloomberg reported.
""Would Nvidia's popping bring down the whole market? It's very possible,"" Arnott said.
Several market commentators have rang the alarm on Nvidia as it surges to sky-high valuations, driven by investor excitement over artificial intelligence. Traders view leading the chipmaker as well positioned to take advantage of a widely expected demand surge for AI-related high-end computing equipment.
Some experts have said the company's stock price is ridiculously high and its valuation is simply unrealistic. Nvidia's shares have rallied 232% so far this year, outperforming all other S&P 500 index constituents by a big margin.
The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is about 117, compared with 26 for the whole S&P 500 index.
""Overconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,"" he said in a separate note, cited by Bloomberg. ""Nvidia is today's exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection,"" Arnott added.
He said investors were piling into Nvidia because of its market cap size of $1.2 trillion which makes it a ""safe play.""
It's not, however, ""too big to fail,"" but Nvidia is ""too big to succeed,"" Arnott said.
""The risk that we're wrong, that Nvidia's off to incredible things and will go up another 10-fold in the coming 10 years is possible,"" he said. ""I would say it's not plausible, and therefore I'm comfortable calling it a bubble,"" he added.","Nvidia is a stock bubble and its popping could trigger a broader market crash, investing legend Rob Arnott says",485.48001,470.60999,462.41,9,2023,6

Video Transcript
SEANA SMITH: Jared Blikre is here with a closer look at some of those technical moves that we're seeing in the sector. Jared.
JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. So we're looking at some of the worst days here, particularly for Apple and NVIDIA in about four weeks. Let's pull up the technicals for Apple. This is over six months. I put candlesticks here, and I'm going to put on the 50-day moving average so you can see how previously when we were descending from these highs, we skipped right below it. That was a huge down day. We were descending pretty rapidly in here.
I did a study at the time that saw that when Apple falls from a record high very quickly, it tends to be prolonged-- in other words, that drawdown tends to be prolonged. And indeed we came right above the 50-day and now we are selling off strongly from it once again. That is a clear technical signal that we are to be on alert for further downside potentially.
Now, I want to take a look at NVIDIA. I'm going to put a 3-month chart. This big red candle up here, that was a record high by the way that occurred on its earnings day. And there was some interesting action with respect to buybacks. They sold about $1 billion worth of stock at $499. It'd never seen that price before, so that was potentially exit liquidity for some insiders. I think the main point here is that NVIDIA has not been able to climb above that high there. So even though we are still close to these record highs, I would be a little bit cautious at this point.
Now, I want to go to XLK, that is the SPDR S&P 500 technology select fund. And I'm going to put a 5-year chart on here so we can see what's happening and put some lines there. I've heard some rumblings on Twitter, tech is setting up for a huge double top here, and here's how this would play out. However, you'll notice that we are missing this final down leg here. And in fact, you would have to breach 120 decisively to the downside in order to get that top information.
Right now, we could easily skirt to new highs. I do want to see a break above these highs here eventually, especially to confirm strength. But for now, I think tech is in a decent position. I'm going to show you Microsoft. Microsoft also in a very similar chart, but also decent position.
And then just finally, on the tech note, software versus SOXX-- that is the chip stock. Software over the year to date, that is actually the-- excuse me, the SOXX is actually outperforming year to date. However, over the last month, you will see that software has come from behind. And so software indeed looking a little bit better than the chip stocks at this stage. Seana.",Apple and NVIDIA tumble: What it means for tech investors,485.48001,470.60999,462.41,9,2023,6

(NASDAQ:AMAT): Semiconductor revenue has grown 6% per year since 2010, driven by increasing demand for smartphones, datacentres and electronic content in vehicles and industrial settings.4 Through work spanning six roadmaps covering many sub-themes within semiconductors (including industry consolidation, capital equipment and generative AI), we are confident that these trends will continue or even accelerate in the coming decades. The rise of generative AI in particular will require high-performing semiconductors, such as Nvidia’s GPUs, in datacentres.
Traditionally the industry relied on semiconductor manufacturers to deliver steady advances in semiconductor performance while reducing costs. This phenomenon is known as Moore’s Law, which was identified by Intel founder Gordon Moore. Traditionally, Moore’s Law relied on shrinking the light source used to expose photosensitive material on a silicon wafer to make smaller semiconductors, which in turn led to falling costs.
In recent years, however, Moore’s Law has slowed. Manufacturing has run up against the limits of physics. Making semiconductors smaller more cheaply has therefore become difficult. The latest generation of lithography machines that create this light source are marvels of modern science, but they are also expensive to produce, not to mention power-hungry. Delivering performance improvements in the most advanced semiconductors is now becoming costlier.

Economic data releases and earnings
The Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference in San Francisco this week officially kicked off the fall schedule for investors.
The reason these events matter is simple: It's where public companies rehearse the pitch they'll give to Wall Street through the crucial months that span the end of one year and the beginning of another.
Sure, you will get a few execs who provide a third quarter guidance update after a follow-up question from an analyst. But by and large, fall conference season is a great way for management teams to fine-tune their current and future messaging while they get real-time feedback from investors.
At this year's Communacopia, we've seen many of the biggest themes for investors emerge — AI, the consumer, regulatory risks, and tension in the media business.
But away from these anticipated headlines, here are the seven things yours truly and my colleague Allie Garfinkle have learned from being on the ground and chatting up some of the names running America's biggest public companies.
Palpable fear is in the air about Microsoft (MSFT) strengthening its tentacles within the tech industry, specifically around its investment in OpenAI, which gives the tech giant a strong advantage in the AI race.
Growth stories trading on a decent valuation in tech are being drowned out by the investor love affair with Nvidia (NVDA). Example: Nvidia rival AMD (AMD). One contact who attended Lisa Su's presentation at Goldman came away impressed with their positioning in AI. Nvidia stock is up over 200% this year; AMD has gained just under 70%.
If a company you're invested in isn't discussing what they are doing in automation over the next two years, it's a red flag. Giant companies are trying to bring as much automation as possible to their businesses to counter pandemic-era rises in worker wages and also ride the AI wave.

Nvidia, the recently crowned AI darling, released blowout earnings on Aug. 23. Some analysts called the report a “drop the mic moment that will have a ripple impact for the tech space for the rest of the year.”
The company reported revenue up a whopping 88% from the first quarter, and 101% from a year ago, according to the earnings report.
On Sept. 7, shares of Nvidia were up 229% year-to-date.
Generative AI May Still Have Investment Legs
Yet, some experts noted that the AI craze expands beyond Nvidia, as the industry is only in its nascent stages.
“Mr. Wonderful takes a narrow view of where the opportunity lies for investors seeking to tap into the growth of Generative AI,” said Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.
According to Cohan, while Nvidia is an amazing company with tremendous growth potential, it is a “hedge fund hotel” since May, when Nvidia posted eye-popping revenue guidance adding $250 billion to its market capitalization. Per Cohan, big money is parked in Nvidia and the stock — at 36 times sales — is fully priced.
“There are many other companies that will profit from Generative AI — such as Accenture — which is hiring 40,000 people and investing $3 billion to help companies use Gen AI,” he added.
Another below-the-radar player is Arista Networks, he said, an extremely well-managed networking software firm helping companies build and operate systems to train large language models.
“There is a broad generative AI ecosystem of which Nvidia is the tip of the spear. Investors should look beyond Nvidia to find opportunity,” Cohan concluded.

AI Craze Distinct From Dot-com Mania
Meanwhile, other experts also underscored the differences between the AI craze and dot-com mania.
According to Peter C. Earle, economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, it’s important to remember that “pure plays are often the bleeding edge of investment sentiment, but that the real application of new technologies tends to have its biggest impact in mundane firms over a very long period of time.”
“Sure, there were lots of dot-com stocks that went public, saw their valuations explode, and then crashed and burned while the real beneficiaries of internet technology were staid brick and mortar companies over a period of 10 or 15 years,” said Earle. He added that while there will be direct AI investments, in the long run the economic impact of those innovations will be most effectively applied by companies we already know and engage with daily.
“There are likely to be a handful of AI firms that come out of nowhere and become industry leaders, but consider where the majority of the dot-com stocks are today,” he added.

To skip the detailed analysis of the AI segment, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Buy.
Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks started to take the market by storm at the start of this year and this AI boom keeps gaining momentum. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that tech stocks are going to keep gaining till the end of the year, mainly due to the AI boom. In an investor note, he said:
""The massive $800 billion AI opportunity is now on the doorstep for the tech sector for the next decade and real monetization of AI is happening much sooner than expected with Nvidia's recent guidance and our channel checks giving further confidence in our AI bullish sector call that kicked off in January.""
BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), an investment management company, recently posted a mid-year outlook which states that the market provides ample investment opportunities, especially in the AI segment. The firm believes that the aging/retiring population is creating a labor shortage, which is one of the reasons for inflation in the US. Moreover, global supply chain issues are among the driving forces of increasing production costs. The firm adds that these constraints can be offset with the help of AI. However, the firm also believes that the potential effects of the industry are yet to be completely assessed and there are still some risks involved. The report says:
“We think markets are still assessing the potential effects as AI applications could disrupt entire industries. It goes beyond sectors. Increasing digitalization also brings greater cybersecurity risks across the board.”
Investors are also highly bullish on AI start-ups. In 2021, investments in artificial intelligence start-ups reached a record high of $113.3 billion. In 2023, over 25% of the total investments in US startups have gone toward AI. Two of them include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) backed Anthropic and CoreWeave.
Forbes also provided an outlook on the AI industry and believes that the segment’s market size will reach $407 billion by 2027. On top of that, AI will account for a 21% net increase in the US GDP by 2030. Forbes also believes that AI will have a significant effect on the autonomous vehicles industry as 1 in 10 vehicles will be self-driving by 2030.
Several analysts and investors are considering the recent tech/AI rally an AI bubble. However, companies using AI are more optimistic than ever. At its Q2 2023 earnings call, President & Chief Executive Officer of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDNS), Anirudh Devgan, said:
“With its unparalleled promise, Generative AI is beginning to make a significant impact globally. Our dedicated focus on AI over the past several years, combined with our computational software expertise and invaluable data that lies at the core of AI, is uniquely positions us to deliver to this tremendous potential of this transformational technology.”
During this AI/tech bullish run, some AI stocks have experienced phenomenal stock price gains and the tech heavy NASDAQ-100 gained around to 43% year-to-date on August 29. Some of the fastest-growing AI stocks include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

August exports dropped 7.3% in value from a year earlier to $37.36 billion, the ministry said, the smallest decline and first single-digit percentage fall since October. That compared with a 10.4% fall in July and exceeded a Reuters poll forecasting an 8.05% contraction.
Despite the stagnation in exports, a key driver for Taiwan's economy, the island's GDP returned to growth in the second quarter, helped by resilient domestic consumption.
The ministry forecast improved export performance in coming months, when orders traditionally pick up ahead of the busy year-end shopping season, which is expected to be driven this year by rising demand for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, data centres and automotive electronics.
For September, the ministry said exports may expand, predicting a performance ranging from a contraction of 2% to growth of 2%.
In August, total shipments of electronic components fell 11.2% from the year before to $15.14 billion, with semiconductor exports down 10.4%.
Taiwanese firms such as TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, are major suppliers to Apple Inc, Nvidia and other global tech giants, while providing chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer goods.
TSMC reported earlier on Friday that August sales fell 13.5% year-on-year.
Taiwan's exports to China fell 14.1% in August from a year earlier to $12.98 billion, after the prior month's drop of 16.3%.
Exports to the United States rose 8.8% in August, after slipping an annual 3.3% in July.
Taiwan's August imports, often seen as a leading indicator of re-exports of finished products, dropped 22.9% to $28.77 billion. That compared with economists' forecasts of a 16.3% fall.

NVDA,2023-09-08 22:34:10,"""We can't believe we feel the need to write this note today. And yet, here we are,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said.","A conspiracy theory surrounding Nvidia has made the rounds on social media, and a Wall Street firm is having none of it.
Bernstein debunked the baseless theory that CoreWeave is a shell company driving much of Nvidia's recent growth.
""We can't believe we feel the need to write this note today. And yet, here we are.""
""Please don't get your investment thesis from Twitter randos.""
That's the main message behind a Wednesday note from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who felt forced to dispel a conspiracy theory about Nvidia after it made the rounds on social media this week, prompting his clients to ask whether it has any merit and if it could be hurting Nvidia's stock.
""We can't believe we feel the need to write this note today. And yet, here we are,"" he wrote.
The bearish chatter on social media goes something like this: Much of Nvidia's growth this year has been fueled by GPU sales to an alleged shell company named CoreWeave, a startup founded by three commodity traders in 2017 that was initially focused on crypto mining.
Conspiracy theorists point to Nvidia's second-quarter results, in which revenue more than doubled while cost of goods sold rose by only 7%.
Further fueling their skepticism is a web of connections between Nvidia and CoreWeave. For example, Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave earlier this year. CoreWeave also raised $2.3 billion in debt from Magnetar Capital and Blackstone last month, and used its horde of Nvidia chips as collateral. CoreWeave plans to use the debt to buy more chips from Nvidia and hire more talent to help build out its cloud platform.
Nvidia and CoreWeave declined to comment.
But in his note to clients, Rasgon thoroughly debunked the conspiracy mongering.
""Beyond somewhat hilariously confusing 'Blackstone' with 'Blackrock' during the process, this is also nonsense. Nvidia did not need help from CoreWeave (or anyone) to juice the quarter (their products are all on allocation), and the [CoreWeave] debt facility was announced August 3 (after the quarter was completed) with the release suggesting deployment has likely not happened yet,"" he said.
CoreWeave is a real company that has pivoted away from its crypto origins and is now focused on building a GPU cloud platform using Nvidia's highly sought-after H100 chips. It's not a shell company. CoreWeave recently announced a new $1.6 billion data center in Texas and plans to have 14 data centers up and running by the end of the year.
And while Nvidia did buy a stake in CoreWeave, it also invested in 10 other AI startups so far this year.
""As companies like CoreWeave build businesses based on NVIDIA GPUs it is in NVIDIA's interest to see them succeed given their presence offers a counter to the threat of bigger Cloud Service Providers developing their own internal AI offerings,"" Rasgon said.
Finally, he said there is a simple explanation behind Nvidia's 7% increase in cost of good sold (COGS) last quarter even as revenue surged more than 100%.
""The actual explanation is much more prosaic, to wit, the company took $1.34B in charges (~$1.22B in inventory reserves and $122M in warranty reserves) that ran through cost of goods sold in the year-ago quarter. Closer reading of the requisite filings would find that excluding charges COGS actually increased by ~70% YoY in FQ2 along with 101% increase in revenue, a ~76% incremental gross margin and entirely normal given the YoY strength in datacenter,"" Rasgon said.
He reiterated his ""Outperform"" rating on Nvidia with a $675 price target, representing potential upside of 46% from current levels.",Wall Street analyst defends Nvidia from 'Twitter randos' spreading bearish conspiracy theory,462.41,455.72,451.78,9,2023,8

(Reuters) - Nvidia's supremacy in building computer chips for artificial intelligence has chilled venture funding for would-be rivals, investors said, with the number of U.S. deals this quarter falling 80% from a year ago.
The Santa Clara, California company dominates the market for chips that work with massive amounts of language data. Generative AI models get incrementally smarter through exposure to more data, a process called training.
As Nvidia has grown stronger in this area, the harder it has become for companies attempting to build competing chips. Seeing these startups as a riskier bet, venture financiers are newly unwilling to provide big cash infusions. Advancing a chip design to a working prototype can cost more than $500 million, so the pullback has quickly threatened the startups' prospects.
""Nvidia’s continued dominance has put a really fine point on how hard it is to break into this market,"" said Greg Reichow, a partner at Eclipse Ventures. ""This has resulted in a pullback in investment into these companies, or at least into many of them.""
U.S. chip startups have raised $881.4 million through the end of August, according to PitchBook data. That compares to $1.79 billion for the first three quarters of 2022. The number of deals has dropped from 23 to four through the end of August.
Nvidia declined to comment.
AI chip startup Mythic, which has raised about $160 million in total, ran out of cash last year and was nearly forced to halt operations, technology website The Register reported. But it managed to bring in a relatively modest $13 million investment several months later in March.
Nvidia has ""indirectly"" contributed to overall AI chip fundraising woes, because investors want ""Home run only type investments with a huge investment, huge return,"" Mythic CEO Dave Rick said.
Difficult economic conditions have added to the downturn in the cyclical semiconductor industry, Rick said.
A secretive startup called Rivos, which is working on chip designs for data servers has had trouble raising funding recently, said two sources familiar with the company's situation.
A Rivos spokesperson said Nvidia's market dominance hasn't hindered its fundraising efforts and its hardware and software ""continues to excite our investors.""
Rivos is embroiled in litigation with Apple, which has accused Rivos of stealing intellectual property, and this has compounded the fundraising challenge.
DEMANDING INVESTORS
Chip startups looking to raise cash are facing tougher demands from investors. They require companies to have a product that is within months of launch or already generating sales, sources said.
About two years ago, new investments in chip startups were often $200 million or $300 million. That has fallen to about $100 million, according to PitchBook analyst Brendan Burke.
At least two AI chip startups have overcome investor reluctance by trumpeting potential customers or their relationships with well-known executives.
To raise $100 million in August, Tenstorrent boasted about CEO Jim Keller, a near legendary chip architect who has designed chips for Apple, Advanced Micro Devices and Tesla.
D-Matrix, which has projected revenue of less than $10 million this year, raised $110 million last week, bolstered by financial backing from Microsoft and a commitment by the Windows maker to test d-Matrix's new AI chip after it launches next year.
While these chip makers in Nvidia's shadow struggle, startups in AI software and related technologies do not face the same constraints. They brought in about $24 billion in funding this year through August, according to PitchBook data.
Despite Nvidia's dominance in AI computing, the company does not have an unassailable lock on the sector. AMD plans to launch this year a chip that will compete with Nvidia's, and Intel leapfrogged development by gaining a rival product in an acquisition. Sources see these as having long-term potential to become alternatives to Nvidia's chip.
There are also adjacent applications that could provide openings for competitors. For example, chips that perform data-intensive computing for prediction algorithms are an emerging niche. Nvidia does not dominate this area and it's ripe for investment.

NVDA,2023-09-11 16:54:44,Apple's market reach is quite impressive. But can it sustain its growth?,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Next is Apple, the one and only maker of smartphones, computers, and everything else.
Apple stock (AAPL) isn't having its best moment after reports of an iPhone ban in China sent shares spiraling and the company saw $200 billion slashed from its market cap in 48 hours last week.
But there's no need to panic, experts say. The big picture for Apple looks pretty darn impressive.
Apple has a ""golden installed base of 2 billion consumers,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. ""That's the key — Apple is the hearts and lungs of Cupertino, and it's the best consumer brand in the world.""
""There’s so much to like about it,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick added. ""It's not a question of whether Apple is great. It's whether we're thinking about it the right way.""
Apple stock: Value or growth?
That said, it's not clear where Apple finds its next phase of mega-growth.
""Is there another category killer coming down the pike for Apple?"" Sosnick said. ""I don’t know, but Apple is a mature, dominant player in the smartphone industry, and they have more cash than they know what to do with, which is a tell. A fast-growing company has to use that cash.""
""I’m not saying that they can’t pull a rabbit out of a hat,"" he continued. ""It’s just not clear what growth rate a company that huge can sustain.""
In short, Apple is in the weird interim space between blue chip and growth stock.
According to Sosnick, the stock has ""many of the characteristics of a great value stock,"" such as stable earnings, but the market isn't pricing it ""as a true growth or as a true value stock.""
""Is the market too optimistic about Apple’s growth prospects?"" Sosnick said. ""If you think of it as a value stock, it’s really appealing, but it’s not priced that way.""
Nevertheless, there's hope for major growth for Apple, since emerging markets like India represent huge opportunities for Apple moving forward.
But that will take some time, and Ives believes it will be AI that will send Apple barreling forward.
""This is just the middle innings of the next growth cycle with AI as a major tailwind for Apple heading into 2024 and beyond,"" Ives said.
What should you do with Apple stock?
If you buy that Apple still has the firepower to become even bigger and grow even more when it's already one of the biggest companies in history, more power to you. I'm personally more circumspect.
What does Wall Street have to say? Currently, analysts' recommendations come out to 35 Buys, 14 Holds, and four Sells.
Sosnick has one question Apple investors should perhaps consider asking themselves: ""Are you paying for their dominance, are you paying for their staying power, or are you paying for their growth?""
""Those are all different calculations,"" he said.

(Reuters) - An artificial intelligence benchmark group called MLCommons unveiled the results on Monday of new tests that determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware can run AI models.
A Nvidia Corp chip was the top performer in tests on a large language model, with a semiconductor produced by Intel Corp a close second.
The new MLPerf benchmark is based on a large language model with 6 billion parameters that summarizes CNN news articles. The benchmark simulates the ""inference"" portion of AI data crunching, which powers the software behind generative AI tools.
Nvidia's top submission for the inference benchmark build around eight of its flagship H100 chips. Nvidia has dominated the market for training AI models, but hasn't captured the inference market yet.
""What you see is that we're delivering leadership performance across the board, and again, delivering that leadership performance on all workloads,"" Nvidia's accelerated computing marketing director, Dave Salvator, said.
Intel's success is based around its Gaudi2 chips produced by the Habana unit the company acquired in 2019. The Gaudi2 system was roughly 10% slower than Nvidia's system.
""We're very proud in the results of inferencing, (as) we show the price performance advantage of Gaudi2,"" Habana's chief operating officer, Eitan Medina, said.
Intel says its system is cheaper than Nvidia's - roughly the price of Nvidia's last generation 100 systems - but declined to discuss the exact cost of the chip.
Nvidia declined to discuss the cost of its chip. On Friday Nvidia said it planned to soon roll out a software upgrade that would double the performance from its showing in the MLPerf benchmark.
Alphabet's Google unit previewed the performance of the latest version of a custom-built chip it announced at its August cloud computing conference.

NVDA,2023-09-12 12:48:14,"In a conversation with Yahoo Finance, DeepMind co-founder and AI leader Mustafa Suleyman discussed how AI will dramatically reshape the world in the next decade.","In a world filled with newly minted AI experts, Mustafa Suleyman is one of the OGs.
In 2010, Suleyman co-founded AI startup DeepMind, which we now know as Google (GOOG, GOOGL) DeepMind. Adjusted for inflation, Google's 2014 acquisition of DeepMind reportedly would have been worth more than half a billion dollars today.
And Suleyman has kept going. In March 2022, after years at Google and VC firm Greylock Partners, Suleyman teamed up with Reid Hoffman — LinkedIn co-founder, former COO at PayPal, and Silicon Valley legend — to found Inflection AI.
Already, Inflection AI has gained attention from investors, this summer raising $1.3 billion from big names such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA).
Suleyman also found the time to write a book, called ""The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century's Greatest Dilemma.""
Yahoo Finance spoke with Suleyman on Friday in the midst of his book tour about AI's present and future. Inflection AI's chatbot, Pi, also made an appearance.
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
You've been working in and thinking about AI for decades. Why write this book now?
In the last two or three years, we've been able to see the impact of multiple compounding exponentials. ... We're at an inflection point, and that's why I wrote the book. Because it's just quite obvious that things are about to be very different in the next five to ten years.
Hundreds of millions of people will get access to intelligence, which is going to become a commodity. It's going to be cheap and easy to have an aid in your pocket. It'll be a friendly companion, but it'll also be a teacher. It'll be a coach. It'll be a scheduler, an organizer, a therapist, and an advisor. That's going to change everything.
I want to start by looking at the big picture. This AI wave is coming whether we like it or not, so how should we think about it?
We've always faced new technologies that, at first, seem really daunting and as though they're going to upend everything in a bad way. When airplanes first arrived, people thought they were completely insane, and that they'd always be really dangerous and unreliable. It took many years to get widespread adoption, for them to become safe enough that people feel comfortable on them. We're really just getting adjusted to what these new technologies can do, how they can help, what their risks are, and managing a new type of risk.
So, in essence, what's a good outcome for AI?
A good outcome is one in which we manage the downsides and that we unleash this technology to deliver radical abundance. Food production, energy production, materials production, transportation, healthcare, and education are going to get radically cheaper in the next 30 years.
Unfold that trajectory over the next 20 to 30 years, and there's very good reason to be optimistic on all fronts. ... The real challenge for us is going to be how do we manage abundance? How do we handle the distribution and govern this new power and make sure it remains accountable? But the upside is unbelievable.
What does the negative outcome for AI look like, where the risks run away from us?
The risk is a one of the proliferation of power. We give up power to the nation-state, and in return, we ask the nation-state to provide for us. The challenge is we're now putting the power to have an impact in the hands of hundreds of millions of people.
As in the last wave, the last 20 years, we've put the power to broadcast in the hands of millions of people. Anyone can have a Twitter account or Instagram or TikTok. Anyone can have a podcast, have a blog. That's been an amazing achievement of civilization, having the freedom to speak without having access to traditional news institutions.
Now, that same trajectory is going to take place for the ability to act in the world. ... People are going to have more agency, more power, and more influence with less capital investment. That's the nature of our globalized world, but this is an additional fragility amplifier on top of that.
To that end, tell me about your take on AI regulation, which is a key part of this book, particularly the idea of ""containment.""
Containment is just a simple idea that says that we should always have control over the things that we create, and they should always operate within pre-defined boundaries in repeatable, predictable ways. It should always be accountable to owners, creators, users, and ultimately democratic governments.
It's kind of just restating the obvious fact that technology shouldn't get out of our control. The whole effort here is to place guardrails and permanent constraints around technology so society collectively makes decisions about how it impacts our world. ... If we just leave this to the market, it's going to produce forces beyond our control, and that's the thing that needs to shift.
I'm both really compelled by the idea of containment and skeptical of it. Can you speak to why you believe it's possible to contain this evolution?
It's extremely tough. We haven't really done it before. When there's a technology that's useful and massively impactful in our world, it has always proliferated, it has always spread. It would be an unprecedented challenge, but if you look back through history, there are countless moments when we have confronted seemingly unprecedented moments very successfully.
Roads are a great example, they're actually incredibly regulated. Every inch of that infrastructure is regulated, including the intensity of the lumens of the light bulb and the width of every lane, everything from driver training to airbags to the car itself to emissions. You can't drive through any field or sidewalk, right? It sounds obvious, but that's what we mean by containing technology in a way.
You've identified a new Turing Test — explain.
The new Turing Test is trying to measure not just what AI can say but what it can do. The modern Turing Test I've proposed is to say that an AI, with a $100,000 investment, can go off and make one million dollars in three months.
The idea isn't to make money, but the goal is really to use money as a measure of progress towards a more powerful system. ... AI would have to go and invent a new product, use an image generator to produce a bunch of examples, produce a blueprint for its design, identify a manufacturer, call the manufacturer to negotiate, email back and forth on the contract, get the product shipped to customers, and on and on. That's a pretty challenging set of tasks.
Do you think AI is a job killer or a job creator?
It's going to change the way that we work, so fundamentally that's going to get rid of some roles. But it's also likely to create a lot of brand-new roles.
That's what we have to use taxation for. We have to manage the transition, so people will have time to find other work, train, learn new skills, and not get cut out of employment entirely. ... If you want to speed something up, then reduce the taxes. If you want to slow something down, then increase the taxes. So we do have a lever for containment, and that's adding friction with new taxes.
The final question, I gave to Inflection AI's chatbot, Pi: Should humans be afraid of AI?
Pi: That's a really common question, and it's understandable why people might be worried about AI. After all, we've seen movies like Terminator or Ex Machina where AI goes rogue and harms humans. But I think it's important to keep in mind that these are just works of fiction. In reality, AI is developed by humans and is designed to be helpful, not harmful. Sure, there are risks associated with AI, but I think they can be mitigated with proper regulations and oversight. Ultimately, I think AI can be a force for good if we develop and use it responsibly.

Led by Atreides Management with participation from Sutter Hill Ventures, Nvidia, IAG Capital Partners, Liberty Global Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Infinitum Partners and Alumni Ventures, the new tranche brings Enfabrica's total raised to $148 million. Sankar says that it'll be put toward supporting Enfabric's R&D and operations as well as expanding its engineering, sales and marketing teams.
""It's notable that Enfabrica raised a round of this magnitude in a highly challenging funding environment for chip startups -- and venture-funded deeptech in general -- and, in doing so, has set itself apart from many of its chip startup peers in the industry,"" Sankar said. ""As generative AI and large language models continue to drive the largest infrastructure push in cloud computing across a multitude of industries, solutions like Enfabrica’s have the potential to address a very high demand for networking technologies.""
Enfabrica might've emerged from stealth in 2023, but it began its journey in 2020. Sankar, formerly the director of engineering at Broadcom, teamed up with Shrijeet Mukherjee, who previously headed up networking platforms and architecture at Google, to build a startup -- Enfabrica -- to meet what they observed as growth in the AI industry's appetite for ""parallel, accelerated and heterogeneous"" infrastructure -- in other words, GPUs.
""We reasoned that networking silicon and systems needed to follow a similar paradigm shift to enable this kind of compute infrastructure at massive scale,"" Sankar said. ""The biggest challenge posed by the current AI revolution is the scaling of AI infrastructure – both in terms of cost of compute and sustainability of compute.""
With Sankar as CEO and Mukherjee as chief development officer, along with a few founding engineers hailing from companies like Cisco, Meta and Intel, Enfabrica began developing an architecture for networking chips that could deliver on the I/O and ""memory movement"" requirements of parallel workloads, including AI.
Sankar asserts that conventional networking chips, such as switches, struggle to keep up with the data movement needs of modern AI workloads. Some of the AI models being trained today, like Meta's Llama 2 and GPT-4, ingest massive data sets during the training process -- and network switches can end up being a bottleneck, Sankar says.
""A significant portion of the scaling problem and bottleneck for the AI industry lies in the I/O subsystems, memory movement and networking attached to GPU compute,"" he said. ""There is a massive need to bridge the growing AI workload demand to the overall cost, efficiency, sustainability and ease of scaling the compute clusters on which they run.""
In its quest to develop superior networking hardware, Enfabrica focused on parallelizability.
Enfabrica's hardware -- which it calls the Accelerated Compute Fabric Switch, or ACF-S for short -- can deliver up to ""multi-terabit-per-second"" data movement between GPUs, CPUs and AI accelerator chips in addition to memory and networking devices. Employing ""standards-based"" interfaces, the hardware can scale to tens of thousands of nodes and cut GPU compute for a large language model (along the lines of Llama 2) by around 50 percent for at the same performance point, Enfabric claims.
""Enfabrica’s ACF-S devices complement GPUs, CPUs and accelerators by providing efficient, high-performance networking, I/O and memory attached within a data center server rack,"" Sankar explained. ""To that end, the ACF-S is a converged solution that eliminates the need for disparate, traditional server I/O and networking chips such as rack-level networking switches, server network interface controllers and PCIe switches.""
A rendering of Enfabrica's ACF-S networking hardware.
Sankar also made the case that ACF-S devices can benefit companies handling inferencing -- that is, running trained AI models -- by allowing them to use the fewest possible number of GPUs, CPUs and other AI accelerators. That's because -- according to Sankar -- ACF-S can make more efficient use of existing hardware by moving vast amounts of data very quickly.
""The ACF-S is agnostic to the type and brand of AI processor used for AI computation, as well as to the exact models deployed -- allowing for AI infrastructure to be built across many different use cases and to support multiple processor vendors without proprietary lock-in,"" he added.
Enfabrica might be well-funded. But it isn't the only networking chip startup chasing after the AI trend, it's worth noting.
This summer, Cisco announced a range of hardware -- the Silicon One G200 and G202 -- to support AI networking workloads. For their parts, both Broadcom and Marvell -- incumbents in the enterprise networking space -- offer switches that can deliver up to 51.2 terabits per second of bandwidth; Broadcom recently launched the Jericho3-AI high-performance fabric, which can connect to up to 32,000 GPUs.
Sankar wasn't willing to talk about Enfabrica's customers, as it's relatively early days -- part of the latest funding tranche will support Enfabrica's production and go-to-market efforts, he says. Still, Sankar asserts that Enfabrica is sitting in a position of strength given the attention on -- and enormous investments being made in -- AI infrastructure.
According to the Dell'Oro Group, AI infrastructure investments will raise data center capital expenditures to over $500 billion by 2027. Investment in AI-tailored hardware broadly speaking, meanwhile, is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 20.5% over the next five years, according to IDC.
""The current cost and power footprint of AI compute, whether on-prem on in the cloud, is -- or if not, should be -- a top priority for every CIO, C-Suite exec, and IT organization who deploys AI services,"" he said. ""Despite the economic headwinds that have impaired the tech startup world since late 2022, Enfabrica has advanced its funding, product progress and market potential by virtue of a substantially innovative and disruptive technology to existing networking and server I/O chip solutions [and] the magnitude of the market opportunity and technology paradigm shift that generative AI and accelerated computing has given rise to over the past 18 months.""

Stocks struggled for direction Tuesday as investors looked ahead to Wednesday's critical inflation update and took in an onslaught of headlines from the tech sector.
Notably, mega-cap tech stock Apple (AAPL) continued its recent price struggles as the company unveiled its latest line of iPhones at an annual product event.
The bulk of today's attention swirled around expectations for tomorrow morning's release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI). Many experts believe headline CPI accelerated in August as gas prices jumped. However, the core CPI reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to decline on an annual basis vs July's figure.
""This is one of the last pieces of key economic data ahead of the Fed's rate decision and I think it would take a shockingly hot number to push the Fed to hike next week,"" says Michael Reinking, senior market strategist at the New York Stock Exchange.
Indeed, futures traders are currently pricing in a 93% chance the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at next week's meeting, according to CME Group.
Arm prepares to go public in blockbuster IPO
Tuesday's headlines were not solely centered on tomorrow's inflation data, though. Also in focus was Arm – the Softbank-owned chipmaker that was once a buyout target of Nvidia (NVDA) – given the company is set to go public this Thursday. Demand for what is arguably the most anticipated upcoming IPO of the year is so high that Arm stopped taking orders Tuesday – a day ahead of schedule.
The Arm IPO is expected to be priced tomorrow at a range of $47 to $51 per share, which would result in $5 billion in new capital for the company and a roughly $54.5 billion valuation.
However, David Trainer, CEO of artificial intelligence-powered research firm New Constructs, a research firm powered by artificial intelligence, says this offering creates ""a valuation that is completely disconnected from the company’s fundamentals.""
Stay away from this IPO, Trainer warns investors, ""as we see very limited upside ahead, as there are plenty of other companies in the tech sector that offer investors growth, but at a reasonable valuation.""
Apple stock slips after September event
Also in focus Tuesday was Apple (AAPL), which slid 1.7% as the company unveiled new products at its annual September event. In addition to the iPhone 15 series, the tech giant debuted its latest smartwatch iterations, including the Apple Watch 9.
Meanwhile, amid this week's relatively light earnings calendar, Oracle (ORCL) plunged 13.5% after the cloud software company revealed its results. While Oracle reported higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.19 per share, revenue of $12.45 billion fell short of estimates. Additionally, the company forecast lower-than-anticipated fiscal Q2 results.
As for the major indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished marginally lower at 34,645, while the S&P 500 (-0.6% at 4,461) and the Nasdaq Composite (-1.0% at 13,773) suffered bigger losses.

The intrinsic value of NVDA
Jen Huang is the President and CEO of NVIDIA Corp, a leading company in the technology sector. NVIDIA Corp is renowned for its groundbreaking work in visual computing. The company's graphics and computing technologies are used in a wide range of markets, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive.
The insider's recent sell-off is part of a broader trend within NVIDIA Corp. Over the past year, there have been 33 insider sells and no insider buys. This trend is illustrated in the following image:
The relationship between insider transactions and stock price is complex. Generally, insider selling can be seen as a bearish signal, suggesting that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's prospects are choosing to reduce their holdings. However, it's important to note that insiders may sell shares for a variety of reasons unrelated to the company's performance or prospects.
On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of NVIDIA Corp were trading for $448.99 apiece. This gives the stock a market cap of $1,109.671 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 108.52, significantly higher than the industry median of 24.89 and the companys historical median price-earnings ratio.
According to GuruFocus Value, NVIDIA Corp is modestly overvalued. With a price of $448.99 and a GuruFocus Value of $364.20, the stock has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.23. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts. The GF Value is illustrated in the following image:
In conclusion, while the insider's recent sell-off may raise eyebrows, it's crucial to consider the broader context. NVIDIA Corp's high price-earnings ratio and modest overvaluation suggest that the stock's current price may not be sustainable. However, the company's strong position in the technology sector and the lack of insider buys over the past year suggest that this sell-off may not necessarily be a bearish signal.","Insider Sell: NVIDIA Corp President and CEO Jen Huang Sells 29,688 Shares",451.78,448.70001,454.85001,9,2023,12

Last year saw the many tech stocks driven by FOMO (short for the 'fear of missing out') crash in devastating fashion. So far this year, it's been a year that's allowed tech-heavy investors to breathe a collective sigh of relief. Though it's impossible to know what tech plays are in for next, I do think it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the hottest chip plays, especially those with growing exposure to the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
The AI revolution seems to have arrived, and with it, has been impressive gains. Even if AI continues to deliver riches, it's really hard to tell who the winners and losers will be after such a euphoric year-to-date run in the broader basket of AI stocks.
In this piece, we'll focus on the hardware side. Nvidia is not only the hottest way to play AI chips, but it's also one of the hottest technology companies on the planet, with the firm coming off two absolutely magnificent quarterly beats on the bottom line.
Lam Research is a wafer-fabrication equipment maker that also stands to gain a lot from the AI-driven pop in chip demand. Just over a week ago, the firm crushed its sales estimates, thanks in part to the AI boom.
So, should investors just ""give in"" and buy Nvidia stock while it's trading at more than $450 per share? Or could another hardware play be richer with value and upside? Let's have a closer look at the two names so value investors can make a more informed decision!
Nvidia
Nvidia stock somehow continues to defy the laws of gravity. Indeed, standing pat due to valuation concerns seems to have been the wrong call. Shares of NVDA have always been quite pricy. With the unprecedented demand for AI chips, a large premium is more than justified. But with so much hype already priced in, ""bubble"" concerns, I believe, are more than warranted.
Personally, I don't think Nvidia stock is a bubble that's just waiting to burst. That said, a huge double-digit percentage plunge shouldn't be out of the question. Even if shares were to get slashed in half from here to $225 per share, they'd still be considerably higher than where they were during last October's tough of around $112 per share.
At the time of writing, shares go for 108.9 times trailing price-to-earnings. That's seriously expensive, with a lot of expectations built in ahead of the company's next quarterly earnings report.
While there's a good chance Nvidia could deliver a third consecutive blowout result, it's tough to tell how the stock will react from its euphoric highs, especially if broader stock markets look to give up the gains enjoyed through most of the year.
Investment expert Rob Arnott views Nvidia stock as a bubble. Should NVDA stock be in for a bubble burst, Arnott believes the AI chip giant could drag the rest of the stock market down with it. Nvidia's valuation concerns are real, but shorting shares could prove just as risky, if not riskier, than going long. Why? Even if Nvidia's in a bubble, it's hard to time when the burst happens. Nvidia stock could easily continue its run and squeeze out the shorts brave enough to take a contrarian view of one of the market's hottest stocks.
Sure, the H100 chip is a marvel. But Nvidia's capability is not enough reason to be a buyer of the stock.
Lam Research
The AI boom has helped give Lam Research a nice lift of late. After delivering a solid fourth quarter that saw earnings per share of $5.98 beat the $5.07 estimate, Lam certainly seems like one of the more modestly-valued semiconductor plays to consider as some sort of catch-up trade.
The company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors play a key role in AI chips. As the AI boom continues, one has to think the demand for such a key component could heat up further.
Lam's CEO Timothy Archer was incredibly upbeat following the latest round of results. In fact, Archer thinks ""emerging growth drivers such as generative AI"" are in the ""initial stages of adoption"" and believes it's vital to invest accordingly to cater to what could be a multi-year AI boom.
I think Mr. Archer is right on the money and could lead LRCX stock to even higher highs as demand for all things AI remains hot. The most compelling part of LRCX has to be the valuation. Sure, the wafer equipment maker doesn't have the type of AI exposure that Nvidia has. However, it can benefit from the continued rise of AI and at a far lower price of admission.
The stock trades at just 19.97 times trailing price-to-earnings, making it one of the more intriguing value options in the entire semi space today.
Conclusion
Unless you're willing to run the risk of a big loss, I'd steer clear of Nvidia stock at these levels. Lam Research stands out as a relative bargain, given its potential to benefit from the AI revolution.",Nvidia vs. Lam Research: Which Hot Stock is More Attractive?,448.70001,454.85001,455.81,9,2023,13

The IPO touches on an array of hot-button issues for tech investors, including potentially excess enthusiasm related to artificial intelligence, as well as geopolitical risks involving China and its role in the chip wars. The offering even includes the world’s most valuable semiconductor company, Nvidia Corp., as a participant.
If all goes well, the debut could boost the reputation of Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder, chairman and chief executive officer. Despite Son’s bold proclamations of having a centuries-long investment horizon, nearer-term success has often eluded him, with many of the IPOs his firm has backed stumbling.
SoftBank, which acquired Arm seven years ago for $32 billion, has helped grow the chip designer and change its business model. The firm’s investment in Arm hasn’t been all smooth sailing, though.
Failed Sale
In 2020, SoftBank tried and failed to sell the company to Nvidia for $40 billion. That move angered customers who didn’t want to see Arm, which supplies the foundational technology used by the mobile-phone industry, fall into the hands of a single buyer.
With that deal off the table, Arm pivoted to an IPO with a plan to raise $4.87 billion and be valued at up to $54.5 billion, a 70% markup to the 2016 purchase price. Arm is now looking to exceed that fundraising goal by pricing the IP0 shares a dollar or more above the $47 to $51 target range, Bloomberg News reported.
The IPO’s design has been both unconventional and conservative at the same time. SoftBank is only looking to float up to 10% of the shares, which could cause a scramble by investors to get their hands on the stock.
In another uncommon move, it’s spreading underwriting fees evenly among the four investment banks leading the offering: Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. Raine Group LLC, which SoftBank owns a stake in, is also advising the company. This model was used by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. almost a decade ago.
Scaling Back
The company initially sought to raise as much as $10 billion and secure a higher valuation, Bloomberg News has reported, but dialed back those plans after SoftBank decided to buy the roughly 25% stake held by its own Vision Fund and to keep the float smaller. The shares that changed hands in that deal put Arm’s value at $64 billion, almost $10 billion more than at the top end of the IPO range.
Arm is setting aside more than $700 million of the stock in the IPO to be bought by some of its biggest customers, including Intel Corp., Apple Inc., Nvidia, Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
With only $14 billion raised in US IPOs this year compared with $244 billion at this point in a record-setting 2021, arranging anchor investments ahead of a listing is proving popular with other IPO candidates, too. Instacart Inc. and Klaviyo Inc. also are bringing on investors in advance of their listings.
The participation of anchor investors, combined with the smaller float, could deter funds from flipping shares for a quick sale once they start trading on Nasdaq.
If Arm’s listing and those by Instacart and Klaviyo go smoothly, others such as software company Rubrik Inc. and car-sharing platform Turo Inc. could follow, Bloomberg News has reported. Bankers and other IPO watchers say successful debuts by those firms or others this year could spur a fuller IPO comeback in the first half of 2024.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's chip designer Arm Holdings Plc was discussing pricing its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) at $52 per share on Wednesday afternoon in a meeting with its investment bankers, a person familiar with the matter said.
If this pricing is finalized, it would be above Arm's indicated $47-$51 price range and would raise $4.97 billion for SoftBank, based on 95.5 million shares sold.
It would infer a valuation on Arm on a fully diluted basis of $55.5 billion, making it the largest stock market debut since electric car maker Rivian Automotive Inc in 2021.
The source requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Arm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Arm was preparing to price its IPO at $52 per share.
Arm's shares are scheduled to start trading in New York on Thursday.
The IPO's valuation would represent a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank last month acquired the 25% stake it did not already own in the company from the $100 billion Vision Fund it manages.
Yet even with this lower valuation, SoftBank would fare better than its $40 billion deal to sell Arm to Nvidia Corp, which it abandoned last year amid opposition from antitrust regulators. SoftBank took Arm private in 2016 for $32 billion.
Arm has already signed up many of its major clients as cornerstone investors in its IPO, including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Samsung Electronics.

The pricing, expected to be confirmed by Arm on Wednesday evening, is higher than the $47 to $51 range Arm had said last week, suggesting strong demand from investors.
The listing is set to be the biggest of the year and is being closely watched as a sign of demand for new stock market floats after months of subdued activity.
Arm’s owner, Japan’s SoftBank, paid £24bn for the company in 2016. It is returning the company to the public markets after seven years amid concerns over its investing success following high-profile disappointments such as WeWork.
Arm this year opted to float in New York, rather than London where it had previously been listed, despite a concerted effort from Rishi Sunak.
Tech giants including Apple, Google and Nvidia are expected to invest in the flotation. SoftBank is only selling around 10pc of the company, but could use a new market in the shares to raise billions in debt using Arm’s shares as collateral.
Arm’s microchip designs are used in billions of smartphones and other devices, and the company estimates that 70pc of the world’s population uses gadgets powered by its technology.
However, investors have raised concerns over the company’s exposure to China, while its revenue fell last year.
The company has reassured investors during an IPO roadshow that it has strong growth potential, leading to demand for shares significantly outstripping supply.
Despite the share pricing, Arm is still valued significantly below $64bn, the valuation at which SoftBank bought the 25pc of the company it did not own from its separate Vision Fund last month.

The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 1.5x Shares ETF seeks to deliver 1.5 times the price return of daily moves in Nvidia’s shares, which have more than tripled year-to-date. Meanwhile, the Direxion Daily NVDD Bear 1x Shares ETF allows bearish investors to profit when Nvidia’s shares decline.
Single-stock ETFs made their debut in 2022, but only a handful of products have since been introduced by five firms, including Direxion. Asset managers employ an array of derivatives to deliver the promised results.
Of course, the potential to make outsized gains comes with greater risk if the market moves the wrong way. Because of their increased exposure, investors’ losses in leveraged exchange traded products can be staggering, analysts said.
“There’s no reason anyone really needs to buy a 1.5x return ETF based only on Nvidia, other than pure speculation,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar Inc.
GraniteShares launched a similar ETF, the GraniteShares 1.5x Long NVDA ETF (NVDL) in December 2022.
Direxion did not return e-mails seeking comment. On its website, a page devoted to the firm’s suite of inverse and leveraged ETFs is accompanied by a note saying that these products are “for traders averse to risk averse.”
In the press release announcing the launch, Edward Egilinsky, managing director of Direxion, said the new funds are “for those who want to take more risk on the AI trade.”
Direxion has had success with leveraged single stock ETFs in the recent past - its Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5x Shares ETF is the largest among the small number of similar funds that have come out in recent years, having attracted $1.1 billion.
Only four leveraged single-stock ETFs currently have more than $50 million, according to Morningstar.

""We've created regulatory agencies before,"" Musk said Wednesday after attending a gathering in Washington with other tech CEOs who convened to discuss AI, according to video of the comments to reporters.
Musk — who also owns X (formerly known as Twitter) and SpaceX — added that he thought a new government agency could be created in the vein of the Federal Aviation Administration or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the coming years ""to insure companies take actions that are safe and in the interests of the general public.""
In his own comments after the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer added that ""we came out of that room exhilarated.""

""That gives us a message here that we have to try to act, as difficult as the process may be,"" he added.
Other high profile attendees at the event included Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates as well as the CEOs of Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and IBM. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, another attendee, called it an “unprecedented moment.”
But both Schumer and Musk and others underlined Wednesday that this week's gathering was only an early step in what could be a long process as Washington tries to get its arms around the new technology.
The options on the table range from a broad approach that regulates AI as a standalone entity — an option Musk alluded to in his comments — to more piecemeal approaches that put the onus for action on existing agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and others to handle different aspects of the sprawling technology.
The debate is likely to rage in the months ahead with it remaining to be seen what business leaders will actually be receptive to when it gets down to specific details. Musk, as one example, has had an often tense relationship with other federal regulators, especially the SEC.
Many experts and business leaders have also been cool on the idea of a new standalone department, with Mark MacCarthy of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution telling Yahoo Finance earlier this week ""a department of artificial intelligence I think would be a big mistake because you can't regulate AI in a single department.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's leading tech firm FPT has orders for nearly 70 million chips through 2025 and is eyeing expansion in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technical training, the company's chief said.
Vietnam-listed FPT is the country's most valuable technology company with a market capitalisation of $5.2 billion on the Ho Chi Minh City bourse. It offers AI, cloud and big data services to clients in 29 countries and is also growing in chip designing and education.
FPT was one of the few Vietnamese companies that attended a business summit with top U.S. tech firms during U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi earlier this week.
Chairman Truong Gia Binh (67), a mathematician trained in Moscow universities, says Vietnam can build on its strong position in AI and both the country and his company can grow faster in the digital sector.
FPT sealed a partnership with U.S. firm Landing AI to boost its training capabilities, the company said. It is also involved in talks with U.S. AI giant Nvidia and other Vietnamese firms to use AI for cloud storage, healthcare and other applications, the White House said.
In an interview with Reuters from his swanky headquarters in Hanoi, Binh said ""new opportunities"" were mostly in the semiconductors sector thanks chiefly to the U.S. CHIPS Act, adopted last year.
The new law was a ""game-changer"" because it created the conditions for foreign countries, ""other than China"", to expand, and U.S. pledges this week to boost Vietnam's chips sector further confirmed that, he said.
FPT has publicly announced orders for 25 million chips through 2025, but Binh revealed total orders were for 67 million chips over the same period, for clients in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan in the medical devices sector and for multiple electronics applications.
Contrary to the market practice of assembling products in Vietnam which are usually conceived elsewhere, FPT has its designed chips manufactured in South Korea or Taiwan - a sort of inverted supply chain compared to South Korean electronics giant Samsung, which assembles about half its smartphones in Vietnam.
Binh said FPT could bring production of its chips to Vietnam within five years, as he saw increasing interest and possible foreign investment in building the first Vietnamese chip factory, or fab.
US LISTING? MAYBE LATER
He said FPT's expansion plans did not currently include a public listing in the United States. ""Maybe one day,"" he noted, underlining he did not see a clear purpose for that at the moment.
The so far successful Nasdaq listing of Vietnamese electric auto maker VinFast in August did not entice him to immediately follow that path, he said.
FPT has U.S. revenues of $250-300 million a year and aims to multiply them to $1 billion before 2030. Binh said a possible U.S. listing could be considered only when a bigger scale was reached there and depending on clients' needs.
He said the company needed to invest more on its education services. FPT already hosts thousands of students in its campus, and aims to fill the training gap in Vietnam's chips engineering workforce which experts estimate needs to be boosted tenfold over the next decade to 50,000.
Binh is ready to push for that, and hopes the U.S. would provide more funds than those announced earlier this week as bilateral ties with Hanoi were upgraded.
JPMorgan forecast that FPT university could train as many as 200,000 students in 2025, from nearly half that figure last year.

How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the world's largest dedicated chip foundry, with almost 60% market share. TSMC was founded in 1987 as a joint venture of Philips, the government of Taiwan, and private investors. It went public as an ADR in the U.S. in 1997. TSMC's scale and high-quality technology allow the firm to generate solid operating margins, even in the highly competitive foundry business. Furthermore, the shift to the fabless business model has created tailwinds for TSMC. The foundry leader has an illustrious customer base, including Apple, AMD, and Nvidia, that looks to apply cutting-edge process technologies to its semiconductor designs. TSMC employs more than 73,000 people.

NVDA,2023-09-14 16:33:57,Investor appetite for shares in SoftBank-owned tech firm pushes valuation towards $64bn in biggest US market listing of year,"The British chip designer Arm looked set to be valued at more than $60bn as it debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the biggest US share listing of the year.
Arm set a price of $51 a share, valuing the company at $54.5bn on Wednesday. But as trading began on Thursday morning, investor appetite for the company’s initial public offering (IPO) pushed its share price up 10% to $56.10, valuing the company at just below $60bn.
It later rose by as much as 20% up, before settling back at 17% up, giving a valuation of around $64bn.
Founded in Cambridge in 1990 as Advanced Risc Machines, Arm supplies chipmakers with circuit designs and is the dominant supplier to the mobile phone market with its circuitry in 99% of smartphones. Japanese investment company SoftBank bought Arm for £24bn ($32bn) in 2016.
The company – and investors – expect its technology to expand into artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the coming years, and other areas including cloud computing and the automotive industry.

Excitement about AI has already driven huge rises in the stock prices of other tech companies. Shares in the US chipmaker Nvidia have more than tripled this year, and in May it became the first chipmaker to be valued at over $1trn.
Nvidia announced plans to takeover Arm in 2020 but the deal collapsed amid regulatory scrutiny from the US, UK and China.
“The Arm IPO is the most hyped listing we’ve had in the markets for a while,” said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at brokerage firm Capital.com. “It will also be a major test of risk appetite and whether these high-growth, speculative companies still attract interest in a new world of higher interest rates.”
Arm is the largest company to announce a share sale this year, which has been the worst for IPOs since 2009, dampened by surging interest rates and still high inflation. The success – or otherwise – of the sale will be closely watched. The grocery delivery company Instacart is also planning an IPO and has cut its valuation to $9.3bn, less than a quarter of the private valuation it enjoyed two years ago.
The sale is also a major test for Masayoshi Son, the chief executive and billionaire founder of SoftBank, after years of high-profile missteps, including his championing of WeWork, the office rental company once valued at $47bn and now teetering on the edge of collapse.
SoftBank’s purchase of Arm came just weeks after the UK voted to leave the European Union. The then UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, hailed the deal: “Just three weeks after the referendum decision, it shows that Britain has lost none of its allure to international investors. Britain is open for business – and open to foreign investment.”
Arm was listed in London and in the US before SoftBank bought it. But in a blow to the UK government, which lobbied hard for a London listing, SoftBank filed for a US-only listing for the company in May.
Arm’s co-founder Hermann Hauser said Brexit “idiocy” was partly to blame for the decision.
“The fact is that New York, of course, is a much deeper market than London, partially because of the Brexit idiocy the image of London has suffered in the international community,” he told the BBC.

""Arm generates very high margin revenue, but much of that is put back into research and development,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.
Analysts have said Arm can potentially ride on the coattails of Nvidia, which has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as its chips would need energy-efficient central processing units (CPUs) - a speciality of Arm.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Newly publicly traded company Arm Holdings is poised to be added to popular indexes such as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, although inclusion in the S&P 500 is unlikely, analysts said.
Shares of the British chip designer closed up 24.7% in their Nasdaq debut on Thursday, giving it a market value of $65 billion. The shares edged down 0.7% in Friday morning trade.
Inclusion in widely-followed indexes and ETFs often gives a fresh boost to stocks. Fund managers and investors who benchmark to indexes are also encouraged to hold the shares if they are included in widely-used gauges.
Analysts said on Thursday that Arm was a likely candidate to be added to the Nasdaq 100 index, which measures the performance of 100 of the largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies and is a key barometer of big growth stocks.
The index is up about 40% this year, largely due to the performance of a handful of megacap stocks including chip-maker Nvidia, whose shares have tripled this year thanks in-part to excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.
“The Nasdaq 100 is the most likely widely followed index for the company to get added into,” said Todd Rosenbluth, Head of Research at VettaFi. “They can be faster to add megacap growth companies into the index than the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000.”
The smallest company in the Nasdaq 100 is Lucid Group, which has a market capitalization of about $13 billion, so ARM should qualify for inclusion based on its market cap, according to Todd Sohn, technical strategist at Strategas.
However, inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 may take time for Arm shares.
In response to a question about eligibility to the Nasdaq 100, a Nasdaq spokeswoman referred to a methodology document that says a security must have traded for at least three full calendar months, not including the month of initial listing, to be eligible for the index.
Moreover, Sohn said, Nasdaq won't be rebalancing this index until December. Inclusion of Arm shares in the S&P 500, which is the standard benchmark for the U.S. stock market, is far less certain, analysts said.
Jeffrey DeMaso, editor at Vanguard Investment Adviser, said the committee that rules on including and removing companies in the S&P 500 and other products has some discretion. But he and other analysts doubted that an index designed to capture the U.S. economy would include a UK-based multinational like ARM.
The fact that the company is based in the UK ""almost says 'no' right out of the blocks to the question of whether or not it's included in any Standard & Poor's index,"" Sohn said. An S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman referred to a methodology document, but said the company is unable to comment or speculate on index constituent changes. Another potential barrier to inclusion in indexes or ETFs is the amount of its shares available to the public. SoftBank still holds a 90.6% stake in Arm, meaning less than 10% are available to the public, and many ETFs have rules on minimum free float requirements that are above that threshold, analysts said. Still, beyond the major indexes, a handful of tech-focused ETFs - all of which hold Nvidia - were strong candidates to pick up shares of Arm, including the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF and the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF, said Lois Gregson, senior ETF analyst at FactSet.

NVDA,2023-09-15 18:00:01,The Softbank-backed chip designer soared more than 20% within minutes of debuting on public markets Thursday.,"Arm stock soared 24% on its first day of trading following its massive IPO.
Investors are cheering the debut, though some experts remain hesitant to use Arm to gauge the broader IPO market.
Sky-high valuations and easy money during the pandemic fizzled out and the IPO market has been in a slump.
Arm's strong trading debut doesn't mean the initial public offering market will come roaring back. Experts say it's mostly a sign of the times and captures investors' massive hype around tech and artificial intelligence.
Arm closed 24% higher on its first day of trading on Thursday, with investors pushing the stock to $63.59 a share, well above its IPO price of $51.
The Softbank-backed tech company, which designs the chips used in most of the world's smartphones, raised about $4.9 billion in its public offering and secured a $54.5 billion valuation.
Daniel Morgan, senior vice president at Synovus Trust Company, told Insider that the stock pop Thursday points less to an IPO resurgence and more to the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence. It's no accident that the debut came relatively soon after Nvidia's blowout earnings.
""I hate to say this, but there are some similarities between this AI mania and the dot-com mania,"" said Morgan, a three-decade market veteran. ""Any company that has anything to do with AI that hasn't gone public, I'm sure investment bankers are knocking on their door saying AI is hot, take advantage of it.""
""There's always the question, is this a new renaissance in the IPO space? But I think the Arm deal is kind of specific,"" he added.
Morgan said the IPO market generally will likely remain more deal-specific around the red-hot technology sector. Upcoming deals that aren't tied to AI or tech, in his view, will see a more muted reception.
To Chuckie Reddy, a partner at fintech venture capital firm QED Investors, if Arm shares had traded down on their first day, that would have been bad news for the IPO market. But their big first-day surge doesn't necessarily open the floodgates for more public offerings.
""If it went poorly, that would be seen as a very negative signal, that the market wasn't ready for companies to go public,"" Reddy told Insider on Thursday. ""But since it went smoothly, it's somewhat of a neutral signal. I don't think it materially increases the odds that others will go public.""
Companies are still trying to shift their priorities from growth to profitability, he explained, and that transition hasn't fully happened yet. A number of portfolio companies at QED, he said, are planning to go public closer to the end of 2024.
Arm marks the biggest US initial public offering since 2021, back when liquidity was high and money was cheap. The broader IPO market has been stuck in a pandemic hangover, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and both investors and companies have had to come to terms with lower valuations compared to a year or two ago.
The next deal on investors' radar will be Instacart, which was worth over $30 billion at the height of the pandemic. It is targeting a valuation in its upcoming IPO of just over $9 billion.",Arm's red-hot stock debut captures the AI hype but it doesn't mean the IPO market has rebounded,455.81,439.0,439.66,9,2023,15

The hype around AI has fizzled out, and the Federal Reserve looks like it'll soon stop raising interest rates.
That's dragged Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" to its lowest level since November 2019.
Stocks are really boring at the moment.
There are lots of people who'd tell you that statement is always true – but in September 2023, it's difficult for even the most ardent markets junkie to find anything to get excited about.
Summing up the lack of drama is the VIX, often referred to as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"".
The index, which tracks how volatile stocks are, dropped to its lowest level since November 2019 Friday – meaning that the last time the market was so calm, Knives Out was still playing in cinemas and the US was yet to record its first COVID-19 case.
While a lack of volatility isn't necessarily bad news, it does reflect a dull few months for investors. The benchmark S&P 500 index has risen just 1% since the end of June.
It's not unusual for stocks to trade flat as Wall Street heads off on its summer vacation, but other factors have also driven the lull in equity markets.
After powering the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of mega-cap tech stocks to massive gains over the first half of the year, the hype for artificial intelligence appears to have fizzled out.
Even 2023's biggest winner Nvidia has barely felt the benefit of that investing theme this summer, with its shares up just 8% since the start of July despite the chipmaker smashing analysts' expectations with a stellar third-quarter earnings report.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve policymakers have signaled the central bank is now close to calling time on its war on inflation, with a CME Group poll showing that most traders aren't expecting any further interest-rate hikes this year.
That's good news for stocks – when borrowing costs stop rising, equities become more appealing relative to other assets like bonds and cash – but it's also taken another source of volatility off the table, with what was once one of investors' biggest fears fading into a non-issue.

Grantham sees a 70% chance of a US recession in the next 18 months.
There's a historic bubble in stocks that's about to burst — and the US economy will most likely suffer a recession, Jeremy Grantham has warned.
""A dozen giant American stocks have had a hell of a run on the back of AI, and that has certainly created the impression that it's game over,"" he said, speaking at an investor event held by Livewire Markets in Sydney this week.
""The problem is prices are incredibly high and basically the economy is beginning to unravel,"" the cofounder and long-term strategist of asset manager GMO continued. ""So it's a head fake, but it's a hell of a head fake.""
Grantham, who's been sounding the alarm since the summer of 2020, suggested the buzz around artificial intelligence has delayed the deflation of the current tech bubble. Stocks tumbled in 2022, but have rebounded this year as investors bet big on key AI players including Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, and Microsoft.
The veteran investor, who oversees his foundation's $1.5 billion of assets, said overseas stocks appear far less overvalued than American ones. If people do want to invest in US equities, they should prioritize high-quality companies that tend to be less indebted and more resilient to an economic downturn, he noted.
""I'm very nervous about an eventual financial trouble,"" Grantham said, echoing his warning earlier this year that the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other regional lenders this spring could herald a ""rolling financial stress.""
The market historian also touted companies involved in fighting climate change as compelling investments.
""I love climate-change stocks,"" he said. ""They will have an incredible top-line revenue growth, driving forward like Tesla and electric vehicles versus the dopey VWs and old-fashioned cars.""
As for the housing market, Grantham advised steering clear. He pointed out that two decades of declining mortgage rates have driven prices to ""really crushing"" high multiples across large parts of the developed world. ""I wouldn't touch real estate,"" he said.
Grantham also cautioned against owning commodities. ""Bear in mind every commodity is a royal pain to own because it has totally unpredictable and shocking drops along the way,"" he said, recommending them only to investors whose ""nerves are strong.""
Recession is still on the table
During the Livewire Markets event, Grantham was asked what he thought the probability of a US recession was in the next 18 months. He replied that it was over 50%, and if he had to be more specific, about 70%.
Inflation has slowed from a historic high of over 9% last summer to below 4% in recent months, fanning hopes that the Federal Reserve will reverse its interest-rate hikes and relieve pressure on the economy. Goldman Sachs sees only a 15% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, and the Fed's staff economists don't expect one either.
""The Fed and the economic establishment, the financial establishment, they always underestimate the probability of a recession,"" Grantham said. ""You always have them, and yet they always say everything will be fine.""
""This is not unusual, it's absolutely inevitable, and here they go again,"" he continued. ""I think it would be unique if we don't have an extended problem with the economy.""",Elite investor Jeremy Grantham warns the stock market's rally this year is a 'head fake' - and a recession is still coming,455.81,439.0,439.66,9,2023,15

""Vietnam is willing to open its doors to all investors to invest and do business there,"" a government statement quoted Chinh as telling a technology business forum in San Francisco during his visit to the United States.
Chinh's trip comes on the heels of a visit by U.S. President Joe Biden to Hanoi this month during which the two leaders announced improved bilateral relations and plans to deepen cooperation in several areas, including chips, AI and critical minerals.
Chinh pledged to facilitate future investments by Nvidia and Synopsys in Vietnam, the statement said.
The statement quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as telling Chinh that ""Nvidia wants to cooperate with Vietnam in semiconductor, information technology and artificial intelligence.""
Synopsys, which has plans to build chip design centres in Vietnam, on Monday signed memorandums of understanding with Vietnam's information ministry and with the investment ministry.
Nvidia, a top supplier of servers to Vietnam, and Synopsys did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
U.S. chipmaker Intel has its biggest factory for assembling, packaging and testing chips in southern Vietnam, while rival Amkor is building a large factory for semiconductor assembly and testing near Hanoi.
Chinh is in the U.S. for the United Nations General Assembly this week, after which he plans to visit Brazil.

The biggest winners have been the mega-caps, companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia, whose size, market share, and exposure to AI have attracted investors in droves.
The result, according to investing legend Jeremy Grantham, is a decidedly unstable situation, reminiscent of past stock bubbles. Grantham, who is the co-founder of Boston-based GMO, a firm that has ~$58.8 billion of assets under management (AUM), has built a reputation as a contrarian with a solid record of success in predicting such bubbles, and sees AI as the shiny new thing preventing a general market collapse.
Markets are still up, but AI is holding them there on dangerously inflated prices. “A dozen giant American stocks have had a hell of a run on the back of AI, and that has certainly created the impression that it’s game over,” Grantham recently said. However, he believes the problem is that prices are “incredibly high” and what we are witnessing is a “head fake, but it’s a hell of a head fake.”
Grantham goes on to add that he is “very nervous about an eventual financial trouble,” by that meaning a potential recession. He believes that there is a serious risk – 70%, in his estimation – that the US economy will contract in the next 18 months. “I think it would be unique if we don’t have an extended problem with the economy,” he ominously added.
So, time to take some protective action. Taking Grantham’s warning to heart, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull the details on defensive stocks, stocks that will provide a level of protection to your portfolio should everything go south. According to the Street’s analysts, these are Buy-rated equities with approximately 25% upside – and some solid defensive attributes. Let’s take a closer look.
Open Text Corporation (OTEX)
We’ll start with a software company, Open Text. This Ontario-based firm is one of Canada’s largest software companies, offering customers an enormous array of products, including cloud-based solutions for app modernization, business networking, content work, and digital experiences. Customers can simplify their systems, build up process automation, and connect data, all in a multi-cloud environment.
The market for information management, Open Text’s niche, is estimated at $200 billion – and it’s expanding. Open Text has staked out a position based on quality products and compelling solutions to meet customers’ cloud-computing needs, while adding to market share. As a measure of the company’s success, the $4.5 billion in revenue for the last fiscal year marked a 28% year-over-year increase, and $3.6 billion of that total, or 80%, is annually recurring revenue (ARR).
If we zoom in and look at the recent fiscal fourth quarter, we find that Open Text finished its fiscal year (which ended on June 30) with solid quarterly results. The top line figure of $1.5 billion represented 66.2% y/y revenue growth, and beat the forecast by $10 million. ARR came to $1.2 billion for a 56.4% y/y gain. The quarter’s operating cash flow was $115 million, a total that included $91 million in free cash flow. At the bottom line, Open Text reported 91 cents per share in non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 4Q23, beating the forecast by 4 cents per share.
This software company’s impressive cash flows caught the attention of Richard Tse from the National Bank of Canada. Noting that the firm’s ability to generate recurring cash is a solid defensive feature, the 5-star analyst writes of this stock, “OTEX remains one of our favourite ‘legacy’ names. Scaling profitability and recurring cash flow offers investors compelling defensive attributes at an attractive valuation. Despite the upside from MF’s integration (the company closed the acquisition of Micro Focus, a provider of mission-critical software technology, in January), we continue to see a growing base of recurring revenue through opportunistic acquisitions, expanding operating leverage and optionality on what appears to be a renewed emphasis back on organic growth, all of which is not fully reflected in the 8.4x F24 EV/EBITDA valuation.”
Tse goes on to give this stock an Outperform (Buy) rating, while his price target of $60 implies a 56% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Tse’s track record, click here.)
Overall, Open Text sports a Strong Buy consensus rating, backed up by 8 recent analyst reviews that include 6 Buys and 2 Holds. The $50 average price target indicates potential for a 12-month upside of 30%. (See Open Text’s stock forecast.)
Valvoline, Inc. (VVV)
The second defensive stalwart we’ll look at is Valvoline, one of the leaders in the global market for automotive fuels and lubricating oils. The company also produces a range of other liquid chemical products for cars, from brake and transmission fluids to engine coolants and anti-freezes, as well as fuel treatments and purpose-formulated lubricating oils, coolants, and transmission fluids for hybrid vehicles.
Valvoline markets its products through a variety of retail outlets, from major chain and big box stores to small independent gas stations – and it operates some 1,800 franchised service center locations through its Valvoline Instant Oil Change and Valvoline Great Canadian Oil Change brands.
The automotive industry has been facing serious challenges in recent years. Headwinds have included supply chain disruptions, labor stoppages (of which the current UAW strike is only the most recent), and increased costs for raw materials, construction, and fuels.
Nevertheless, as was evident in the Valvoline’s most recent quarterly earnings report, from Q3 of fiscal year 2023, the company has been performing well. The quarter, which ended on June 30, showed revenues from continuing operations of $376.2 million, amounting to an 18.5% increase from the previous year period, while the bottom line earnings came in at 43 cents per share by non-GAAP measures. Both revenues and earnings beat the forecasts, revenues by $9.9 million and EPS by 9 cents per share.
In a metric that bodes well for Valvoline going forward, the company recorded an increase of 23 new stores in its branded oil change lines during the quarter. This growth included 22 company-operated locations and 1 franchised store, and brought the full system total to 1,804 stores during Q3. The company reported a system-wide same-store sales growth of 12.5% for the quarter.
In the opinion of Steven Shemesh, covering Valvoline for RBC Capital, the key point here is the company’s continuing unit growth and its potential for future sales. Shemesh writes, “VVV is one of the few names in the hardlines/broadlines that we feel can work regardless of how the macro progresses. Following the sale of its global products division, VVV is now a more defensive and simpler unit growth story (set to grow units +7-10% annually) with pricing power and a $70M+ incremental EBITDA opportunity from existing stores reaching maturity. Largely still under investors’ radar, we feel ~12.5x FY24E EV/EBITDA is a compelling valuation for a name with a long-term guide of +14-16% revenue and +16- 18% EBITDA growth annually (currently ~26% EBITDA margins).”
The analyst’s comments back up his Outperform (Buy) rating on the stock, and he gave VVV a $43 price target that suggests it will gain 32% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Shemesh’s track record, click here.)
Valvoline stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on an even split in the 8 recent share reviews: 4 Buys and 4 Holds. The forecast calls for one-year gains of 24%, considering the average price target clocks in at $40.25. (See Valvoline’s stock forecast.)

NVDA,2023-09-19 15:38:10,"The government has to get out in front of AI regulation, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said.","The government should learn from its mistakes in regulating social media companies (it hasn't) and get out in front of artificial intelligence before the tech becomes too powerful, argued Salesforce (CRM) co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff.
""I think the government is going to have to really step it up and really offer another level of regulation,"" Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) at the company's Dreamforce conference. He acknowledged that AI technology is developing ""much faster"" than those in the industry thought.
Benioff has been a vocal critic of the business practices of social media companies, famously saying in 2020 that Facebook (META) is the ""new cigarettes.""
The government ""obviously failed [on social media regulation],"" Benioff added. ""They get an F for social media and how they've handled them. We've seen that play out. I hope that in AI they really step up and do the right thing.""
As it stands, AI regulation has mostly been a dog and pony show between the government and tech leaders.
Just last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai were among those summoned to Washington to discuss artificial intelligence.
Musk reportedly warned about civilizational risks posed by AI, while others in the room stressed the opportunities with the technology.
Despite the well-publicized gathering of the industry's elite, the timeline for AI regulation remains wildly unclear. What any regulation would look like is also murky — meaning a wave of disruption is coming to businesses and society as large language models (LLMs) gain strength and widespread use.
""If AI is allowed to penetrate the global economy with only light regulation, the most likely outcome is higher growth but with a lot of disruption to existing industries,"" veteran Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote in a new client note.
Tech investor will.i.am is concerned about AI's power to alter public perception.
""2024 is going to be a pretty unique time because we will have so many different types of duping agents out there, where you're not going to decipher truth,"" the musician told Yahoo Finance Live at Dreamforce. ""We are barely dealing with fake news.""
While Big Tech awaits AI guidelines of any form from regulators, a company like Salesforce is full steam ahead in trying to supercharge its profits by unleashing new AI tools across its various lines of business.
A Williams-Sonoma (WSM) exhibition at Dreamforce gave a glimpse into how Salesforce's AI is powering furniture recommendations. And Slack — a business Salesforce acquired in 2021 for $27.7 billion — had a booth explaining how businesses could use new AI features on the platform to build improved marketing campaigns.
""The AI revolution is here,"" Benioff said. The regulators aren't.

NVDA,2023-09-19 16:57:11,"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, created by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, will use the computing system to run openly available AI models, the philanthropy venture said on Tuesday. ""Bringing the power of generative AI to biology at scale will allow researchers to incorporate these technological advances into their work, which will accelerate efforts to cure, prevent, or manage all disease,"" Chan said.","(Reuters) - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropy venture plans to build a computing system powered by artificial intelligence for life sciences research to study human cells and diseases.
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, created by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, will use the computing system to run openly available AI models, the philanthropy venture said on Tuesday.
AI has been used in the life sciences domain for some years. Among the popular platforms, Google DeepMind's AlphaFold can predict protein structures, while Nvidia's RadImageGAN, an AI model for radiology, can catch a broad range of medical conditions, including stroke, heart attack, and cancer.
""Bringing the power of generative AI to biology at scale will allow researchers to incorporate these technological advances into their work, which will accelerate efforts to cure, prevent, or manage all disease,"" Chan said.
The system will be trained on datasets from software tool CZ Cell x Gene, as well as resources from Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network and Chan Zuckerberg Institute for Advanced Biological Imaging, and publicly available data.
The move comes as Meta aggressively rolls out large language models, or LLMs, for businesses. The company released its latest Llama 2 model in July, and offered it for free to businesses of a certain size. Its predecessor Llama was launched in February, with both the models initially pitched to researchers.
Zuckerberg told investors in April that Meta could gain more from crowdsourcing to reduce infrastructure costs and maximize creation of new consumer-facing tools that might draw people to its ad-supported services than by charging for access to its models.

NVDA,2023-09-19 21:25:21,Microsoft may be at an inflection point.,"Now that summer’s coming to an end, that means it’s time to pull out your scarves, grab a pumpkin spice latte, and reassess your tech stocks. This series helps you decide what to do with your shares of the biggest names in tech — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla — known as the Magnificent Seven. Up next is Microsoft, a leader in artificial intelligence.
Microsoft (MSFT) is even bigger than you probably think, and it's gaining momentum.
""This is the year for Microsoft where the aircraft carrier is at its apex, where acceleration starts happening based on changes from some time ago,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance.
Aircraft carriers aren't built overnight. According to Luria, the shift for the tech behemoth now worth over $2.4 trillion began when Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014.
""Microsoft was coming off 15 years of stagnant growth, when the business grew but the stock did not,"" Luria said. ""They'd missed the shift to mobile, and at the time they had been far behind on the shift to cloud. Then, Satya Nadella took over.""
Right away, Nadella sought to make Microsoft less insular.
""He made it into a company that was far better integrated into the soft software technology ecosystem,"" Luria explained. ""The second change he made was to become far more developer friendly, using a more open source approach ... and [making] the business approach more developer friendly.""
Today, Microsoft is everywhere and embedded in our digital lives through cybersecurity, enterprise software, and its cloud business. These days it's even making inroads in search, thanks to the company's leadership in AI.
""The next big disruptive wave is AI, and Nadella recognized that early, which is why they invested in Open AI more than two years ago,"" Luria said, adding, ""Not only did they invest in OpenAI, they put the wheels in motion to adapt their business to AI.""
That's not to say there are no chinks in the armor. This year, Microsoft has been in the crosshairs of a number of cybersecurity failures, including one involving the State Department, which its competitor CrowdStrike was quick to point out.
""These continued developments reveal some of the systemic risks that Microsoft poses to consumers, businesses, and national security as a whole,"" CrowdStrike chief security officer Shawn Henry told Yahoo Finance. ""We should all have higher expectations, and stakeholders across the security ecosystem should work together to restore faith in the security of critical systems.”
The nature of tech itself is also a risk for Microsoft. AI and its disruption could eventually facilitate a decline for Microsoft if it turns out that the giant aircraft carrier can't move fast enough or is headed off course.
""Anytime there's a big disruptive technology, it opens the door for new competitors and new businesses that build their business based on the new technology, and we're at that point in time,"" Luria said. ""That's the biggest risk to all these bigger companies — but specifically for Microsoft.""
So what should you do with Microsoft stock?
Still, as it stands today, Microsoft's AI-powered future looks bright. Currently, Wall Street analysts' recommendations for Microsoft break down to 54 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell.
On Wednesday, Microsoft also announced it will increase its quarterly dividend to $0.75 per share, a 10% increase over the previous quarter’s dividend.
The stock is up 37% year to date, which is unsurprising given the AI-fueled tech rally this year.
""Microsoft has built a formidable position in this generational transition that is AI,"" Tola Capital partner Aaron Fleishman, who previously worked at Microsoft, told Yahoo Finance. ""The early partnership with OpenAI was a stroke of genius that will pay dividends for years to come. Microsoft’s ability to monetize both downstack through Azure consumption as well as upstack through the application layer with Office and other products positions the company particularly well to be a leader in AI for a long time.""
Investors could take a pause on valuation, but the stock isn't in ""runaway"" territory just yet.
""Microsoft's on the higher end of its valuation range, but it's not that high,"" Luria said. ""It traded up to 35 times earnings just a couple of years ago, and now we're closer to 29 or 30 times.""
According to Luria, if you're looking at Microsoft, consider these three things: Watch how it's integrating generative AI tools into products, whether (and how) AI is driving cloud growth, and where competition is emerging — and whether Microsoft seems equipped to handle it.
If it can get all those engines roaring, that giant Microsoft aircraft carrier can go into hyperspace.

NVDA,2023-09-19 23:27:15,"Though investors remain uncertain on Fed policy, AI spending will boost tech stocks higher into 2024, Wedbush's Dan Ives wrote.","AI-driven growth will fuel the tech rally into the year's end and beyond, Wedbush Securities Dan Ives said.
The bull run will continue despite uncertainty over the Fed's interest rates and an elevated 10-year Treasury yield.
Tech spending has been stable in the third quarter, laying the groundwork for further gains
The tech sector will rally well into 2024, as an artificial intelligence spending spree will help it power the sector past policy concerns and higher bond yields, Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives wrote on Tuesday.
""We believe the Nvidia guidance last month heard around the world speaks to a tidal wave of AI-driven spending on the horizon for the tech sector over the coming years,"" he said, estimating tech growth to last for the next 12-18 months.
This year's AI advancements gave rise to the Magnificent Seven, a cohort of leading mega-cap tech stocks that have ballooned to an $11 trillion market cap. In the first half of the year, they accounted for 73% of gains in the S&P 500.
Meanwhile Nvidia, which manufactures the chips that power AI programs, pulled in $13.5 billion in its last earnings report.
According to Ives, stable and improving tech spending in the third quarter has laid the groundwork for a further bullish run into year-end.
That's despite investor uncertainty over the trajectory of monetary policy. Since June, the Federal Reserve has indicated that rates may need to remain elevated, with recent inflation data supporting a higher-for-longer approach as prices appear stubbornly high.
Investors may also be discouraged by bond market signals, with 10-year Treasury yields steadily above 4% since August.
But Ives sees tech overcoming these uncertainties, mainly through the power of AI spending that is set to boost the sector for the next 12-18 months. Meanwhile, heavy enterprise spending is about to pay off for Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, while software, chips, and digital media spending is seen as improving into 2024.
With $1 trillion of tech spending ""in clear sights,"" Ives also suggested that the Fed's monetary hawkishness may end sooner than realized:
""We believe tech stocks rip higher into year-end with the new tech bull market here despite the Street's near-term focus on the Fed, which is starting to finally wave the white flag in our opinion with rate cuts on the horizon in 2024,"" Ives wrote.","Tech stocks will rally through year-end and beyond despite Fed fears as 'tidal wave' of AI spending drives new bull market, Wedbush says",439.66,435.20001,422.39001,9,2023,19

Ho believes the worst of the downcycle has now passed, given aggressive production cuts that suppliers made and the strong demand on the AI servers front. Micron is scheduled to report earnings after the close of markets on September 27th after reporting its worst ever quarter in March. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) held its Innovation Conference and it presented all the right products, until CFO David Zinser warned of excess data center chip inventories during a meeting with analysts.
Micron’s Recovery On The Back Of Microsoft And Nvidia
The 1-beta DRAM chips that Micron makes are designed for data centers, which are boosting demand for the hardware needed to power large language models and generative AI, like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed Open AI’s ChatGPT. With a surge in demand in AI server-build-outs, Ho believes that Micron is well positioned to become a second source Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the second half of 2024.
Micron CFO Also Expressed Optimism In August
Micron’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy showed his optimism regarding pricing trends at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference, as he observed a bottoming out of prices. Murphy predicted strengthening through the second half of the year, under the assumption that the supply discipline is maintained and volume continues to expand.
Intel Might Be Late To The AI Race, But Shouldn’t Be Ruled Out Just Yet
Zinser’s remarks about a slower-than-expected recovery in the demand for data center chips caused Intel shares to drop by 4.5%. Zinser revealed that the inventory of data center processors is taking longer to clear and projected an ""inventory digestion"" phase for Intel during the third and likely fourth quarter of the year, before expecting any positive turnaround in the data center business. But earlier on Tuesday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger provided very powerful news of launching processors designed to power laptops capable of artificial intelligence that are expected to strengthen the company’s product portfolio. This kind of innovation could potentially offset some of the challenges that Intel's data center business is facing. Last month, Gelsinger reaffirmed that Intel is on track to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in leading-edge technology with its “five nodes in four years” strategy. Intel also reiterated that it is developing its AI supercomputer based on its Gaudi AI accelerators and Xeon processors. Therefore, as far as AI goes, Intel is getting there, but this journey will take time.
All That Optimism Is Yet To Be Justified
All in all, both Micron and Intel affirm that their technological catch-ups and turnarounds remain on track, but they are taking significant capital with only hopes that the PC market has hit bottom and data centers still need to turn to growth for all that optimism to gain solid ground.

As the US increasingly clamps down on exports of high-end chips to China and the world seeks an alternative electronics manufacturing base, India could shape up to be a source of AI talent, site for chip production and market for Nvidia’s products.At a meeting with leading researchers in Delhi, Huang spoke of re-training entire swaths of the country’s workforce and building future AI models using Indian data and talent, according to multiple attendees. Huang also told one executive in India’s tech hub Bangalore that he’s a big believer in the country’s engineering talent, particularly graduates from its top engineering schools, Indian Institutes of Technology.
“You have the data, you have the talent,” Huang said at a news conference in Bangalore. Huang added: “This is going to be one of the largest AI markets in the world.”
Nvidia and India have a shared interest in betting on, and speeding up, the country’s AI ascendancy. Chipmakers cannot sell top-end microprocessors to China, which accounts for a fifth of Nvidia’s sales, amid fears the chips could be used to develop autonomous weaponry or wage cyberwarfare. “India is the only market remaining so it isn’t surprising that Nvidia wants to put multiple eggs in that basket,” said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.While Indian engineers are a vital part of the digital workforce, the country is still far away from developing the cutting-edge capabilities needed to manufacture Nvidia’s sophisticated chips. But India has ambitions to boost electronics manufacturing as well as harness AI to buoy its digital economy. The country is plowing billions in subsidies to set up chip manufacturing infrastructure to lure the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp.
“India is strategic to Nvidia’s future,” said Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Ltd. and a designer of vital portions of the country’s massive digital public infrastructure. “The government is aggressively building AI infrastructure and so are large private companies. That’s good news for Huang,” said Nilekani, who dined with the chip billionaire during the visit.
In Delhi, the Taiwanese-American billionaire showed up at the prime minister’s residence in his trademark black leather jacket, braving sweltering 90-plus-degree summer temperatures. Modi later shared that the two talked about “the rich potential India offers in the world of AI.”Huang and Nvidia saw signs of that potential during the trip. India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced during Huang’s multi-city tour that its Jio Platforms would build AI computing infrastructure for the country. The AI cloud will use end-to-end Nvidia supercomputing technologies, the company said in a release. Reliance and another large conglomerate, Tata, will also build and operate state-of-the-art AI supercomputing data centers and offer AI infrastructure as a service for use by researchers, corporations and startups, Nvidia said, without giving details or sharing timelines.
India has had reasonable success in enticing giants Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to shift contract electronics manufacturing from China — to a point where, this month, Apple will sell India-made iPhone 15 devices on launch day. Now it’s turning to semiconductors, armed with some experience in chip design and no history whatsoever in semiconductor foundries. Nearly all cutting-edge chips, including those designed by Nvidia, are made in Taiwan. Over several decades, the country spent billions to reach current levels of manufacturing sophistication.
India wants to catch up, but it faces challenges turning itself into an AI hub. The country currently has no exascale compute capacity — being able to handle a billion billion calculations per second — nor the ready AI talent capable of writing sophisticated software, said Sashikumaar Ganesan, who chairs the computational and data sciences department at Indian Institute of Science. “We have to build not just AI infrastructure but also high-performance computing workforce,” said Ganesan, who was among those invited to Huang’s meeting with AI researchers.
Still, India is a fast-maturing market for high-end technologies, said K. Krishna Moorthy, CEO of trade group India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. That’s created huge demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. “As India’s digital economy grows, the government is mandating data security, data privacy and data localization, and this could require over 100,000 GPUs to build AI cloud infrastructure,” Moorthy said.
The country has telecom giants like Reliance’s Jio which collect billions of data points daily from its half a billion mobile users and hundreds of millions of retailers. “The data generated from 1.4 billion Indians could set the country up for the next phase of digital growth,” said Moorthy. “Huang understands this is where the next phase of growth for AI-enabling chips will happen.”
Nvidia already has four engineering centers in India, including in Bangalore and in the Gurgaon suburbs of Delhi, with a total of 4,000 engineers, its second-biggest talent pool after the US. During his trip, Huang held town halls at each of the locations and stressed the importance of remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving AI marketplace. While speaking to employees, he repeated a line he’s used in public before, offering his twist on the hunt-or-be-hunted adage: Either you are running for food or running away from being food.

Total revenue among the island’s major assemblers and manufacturers fell 12.3% from a year ago to NT$951.41 billion ($29.6 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It deepened the slump from July’s 9% drop, leading to a 7.5% fall for the year so far, mirroring a prolonged decline in sales of smartphones, laptops and other personal electronics that’s lasted since last year.
The surge in demand for artificial intelligence hardware has boosted the fortunes of companies like Quanta Computer Inc., which assembles data center servers and saw its shares rocket to all-time highs this summer. As a major partner of Nvidia Corp., Quanta is seen as a beneficiary of the US chipmaker’s runaway sales of AI accelerators, though those growing orders may take a while to translate into sales — Quanta’s cloud unit expects to double AI server sales next year.

Its performance is usually monitored as a gauge for demand, though the company’s said it faces a bottleneck in providing Nvidia chips, which require its most advanced packaging technique.
Early indications around the debut of Apple’s latest iPhone generation suggest the device is as popular as ever, which may help revive sales for the Cupertino, California-based firm toward the end of the year.

Stocks continued their post-Fed slump Thursday, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing in the red.
While the central bank held rates steady at its September meeting, it left the door open for another rate hike by year's end – news that sent Treasury yields spiking to levels not seen in nearly two decades.
Indeed, the 2-year Treasury yield topped out at 5.202% in intraday trading, its highest mark since mid-2006. And the yield on the 10-year Treasury closed at its loftiest perch since the summer of 2007.
The surging yields turned up the heat on the rate-sensitive tech sector with chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA, -2.9%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, -4.2%) and Arm Holdings (ARM, -1.4%) all ending Thursday with noteworthy losses.
Cisco to buy cybersecurity firm Splunk
One tech stock that went against the grain was Splunk (SPLK). Shares surged 20.8% on news that Cisco Systems (CSCO) will purchase the cybersecurity software firm for $28 billion in cash, making this the networking equipment specialist's biggest acquisition to date. The blue chip stock, on the other hand, slumped 3.9%.
""The new $28 billion bid is a 40% increase from just 18 months ago [when Cisco offered to buy Splunk in February 2022 for $20 billion], which both shows the operational efficiencies that Splunk has created under their new CEO Gary Steele,"" says Third Bridge analyst Joseph Brunetto. ""The acquisition also aligns with Cisco's M&A strategy to bolster their cybersecurity offering.""
FedEx stock pops after earnings
FedEx (FDX) was another stock that traded higher, adding 4.5% after the logistics giant disclosed earnings. In its fiscal first quarter, FedEx reported higher-than-expected earnings of $4.55 per share on in-line revenue of $21.7 billion. The company also lifted its full-year earnings forecast.
""For now, FDX is combating waning revenues with cost cuts, but it is also planning to help restore pricing,"" says CFRA Research analyst Stewart Glickman, who reiterated a Hold rating on the industrial stock. Going forward, the analyst believes there is risk involved with the company's planned January rate increases due to a ""beleaguered consumer"" and ""tenuous macro environment.""
Also in focus were Fox Corp. (FOX, +3.0%) and News Corp. (NWSA, +1.3), with both stocks gaining ground following reports Rupert Murdoch will step down as chair of the two media outlets in November, and be appointed as chairman emeritus. The media mogul will be replaced by his son, Lachlan Murdoch.
""This leadership transition comes at a challenging time for Fox,"" says Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley. ""Following the Dominion Voting Systems settlement earlier this year, the potential liability from the Smartmatic lawsuit still hangs over the company."" The analyst adds that questions also remain on how Fox will handle coverage of the 2024 election cycle, ""a year which will be flush with political ad dollars.""
As for the major indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 1.8% to 13,223, the broader S&P 500 fell 1.6% to 4,330, and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back 1.1% to 34,070.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's craze over generative artificial intelligence has triggered a flurry of product announcements from startups and tech giants on an almost daily basis, but investors are warning a shake out is imminent as cost and profit pressures grow.
The buzz in China, first ignited by the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT almost a year ago, has given rise to what a senior Tencent executive described this month as ""war of a hundred models"", as it and rivals from Baidu to Alibaba to Huawei promote their offerings.
China now has at least 130 large language models (LLMs), accounting for 40% of the global total and just behind the United States' 50% share, according to brokerage CLSA. Additionally, companies have also announced dozens of ""industry-specific LLMs"" that link to their core model.
However, investors and analysts say that most were yet to find viable business models, were too similar to each other and were now grappling with surging costs.
Tensions between Beijing and Washington have also weighed on the sector, as U.S. dollar funds invest less in early-stage projects and difficulties obtaining AI chips made by the likes of Nvidia start to bite.
""Only those with the strongest capabilities will survive,"" said Esme Pau, head of China internet and digital asset research at Macquarie Group, who expects consolidation and a price war as players compete for users.
She added that several leading companies have signaled they will compete on price to gain market share, just as cloud services such as those belonging to Alibaba and Tencent have done.
""In the next six-12 months, LLMs with lower capacities will gradually be eliminated due to chip restrictions, high costs and intensifying competition,"" Pau said.
FOUNDERS AND INCUMBENTS
Opinions on which firms will last vary widely.
Yuan Hongwei, chair of Shenzhen-based venture capital Z&Y Capital, said she believed that only two to three general-purpose LLMs will end up dominating the market.
That is why her firm looks for experienced founders when deciding on which startups to invest in.
Z&Y, whose past investments include drone maker DJI and autonomous driving startup Pony.ai, eventually decided to back Baichuan Intelligence, a five-month-old firm looking to build an open-source AI model to rival Meta Platform’s Llama 2.
Baichuan was started by Wang Xiaochuan, founder of China's No.2 internet search engine Sogou Inc, and became one of the first five companies to receive Beijing's approval to release a public chatbot in late August. The company is on track to close a second round that will value it at $1 billion, Wang said.
""We see an opportunity here,"" Yuan said. ""Wang himself is leading this project. Given his understanding of the digital business, his success with Sogou and how he commands attention industry-wide, we think it is our best bet.""
Several other big name entrepreneurs and tech executives are behind new Chinese AI startups, such as Google China's former chief Kai-Fu Lee and Yan Juejie, a former vice-president of SenseTime.
Others said that China's largest tech companies Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu ultimately had the biggest headstart and deep pockets to succeed, given their large user bases and wide range of services. For instance, they could easily offer generative AI services as an additional plug-in to their cloud users.
""The incumbent tech giants have inherited an unfair advantage of a majority of low-hanging fruit business scenarios from their established ecosystems,"" said Tony Tung, managing director at Gobi Partners GBA.
Tung added that some investors regret prematurely investing in LLM firms at the peak of the hype earlier this year with many such startups struggling to build strong business cases and now looking to partner with tech giants to find use cases or be potentially sold to them.
""Many people end up developing similar LLMs, that are looking for similar problems to solve, with micro innovation in the data processing technique or model architecture,"" he said.
""At this particular moment, investors have certainly sobered up quite a bit compared to early this year.""

That's because there are strong underlying fundamental drivers like AI that should accelerate growth for the sector.
Wedbush says it's eyeing the ""biggest tech revolution we have seen in 30 years"" on the horizon.
A period of higher for longer interest rates won't derail the technology sector, according to a Thursday note from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
The Federal Reserve signaled at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday that the central bank could hike interest rates one more time, and that potential rate cuts in 2024 will be less than what the market expected.
The rapid rise of interest rate in 2022 sparked a brutal sell-off for the technology sector as well as the broader market, but Ives believes tech is primed to withstand an extended period of elevated interest rates because its underlying growth drivers are too strong to ignore.
""Now is not the time to become scared by the Fed/macro backdrop and instead see the forest through the trees in the biggest tech revolution we have seen in 30 years on the doorstep that is bullish for tech stocks with the new tech bull market kicking off,"" Ives said.
And any future interest rate cuts, which the market currently expects at least two of next year, combined with the continued growth of artificial intelligence, should ""create the start of a risk-on environment,"" Ives said.
""It's the rocket ship-like trajectory of AI driven growth that will hit the shares of the tech industry over the next 12 to 18 months that speaks to our unabated bullishness for tech stocks,"" Ives said. The potential of AI has already driven significant upside revisions to the earnings potential of tech companies including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Adobe, among others.
Ives cited that internal checks of enterprise IT spending suggests that overall spending in the tech environment is ""modestly"" improving, which bodes well for software stocks. ""We also see an improving spending for software, chips, and digital media consumer growth into 2024,"" Ives said.
While Ives argument that tech stocks can perform well in the face of elevated interest rates might sound counterintuitive after the 2022 bear market, history suggests that it's more than possible.
Interest rates and technology stocks were negatively correlated throughout all of 2022, as interest rates rose and tech stocks fell sharply. But 2023 has been a different story, as the 10-year US Treasury rate has jumped 15% year-to-date to 4.49% while the Nasdaq 100 has jumped 35% year-to-date.
Technology stocks and interest rates were also positively correlated in the second half of 2020 and throughout most of 2021.","Higher for longer interest rates won't derail the tech sector, Wedbush says",422.39001,410.17001,416.10001,9,2023,21

NVDA,2023-09-25 17:44:35,A ChatGPT rival co-founded by a British former journalist has secured $4bn (£3.3bn) from Amazon as the tech giant seeks to catch up in the artificial intelligence race.,"A ChatGPT rival co-founded by a British former journalist has secured $4bn (£3.3bn) from Amazon as the tech giant seeks to catch up in the artificial intelligence race.
The company is investing in Anthropic, a high-profile Silicon Valley lab formed by a team of researchers who quit OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in protest at its direction.
They include Jack Clark, a former journalist who studied creative writing and worked as a reporter at technology news website The Register and Bloomberg, where he covered artificial intelligence, before joining OpenAI.
Mr Clark also worked with the Government’s AI ethics body, the Centre for Data and Ethics Innovation, as a member of its recently disbanded advisory board.
A team of former OpenAI researchers quit the company in 2021 in protest at what they saw as a lax approach to safety. They include Dario Amodei, OpenAI’s former research head, who is now Anthropic’s chief executive.
The company was reportedly valued at $5bn by a separate investment earlier this year.
Amazon’s investment marks a response to Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI and has since enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the company, incorporating ChatGPT’s technology into many of its services such as its search engine, Bing.
Amazon is the world’s biggest provider of cloud computing, which many AI companies rely on to develop their high-powered systems. However, its chief rivals Microsoft and Google have been seen as stealing a march on the company with a string of investments in AI labs.
Amazon also hopes that its AI microchips can become an alternative to those provided by Nvidia, which has become one of the world’s most valuable companies on the back of the AI boom.
Anthropic has sought to be a pioneer of safe development of cutting-edge AI models, emphasising the “responsible” development of the systems.
Its chatbot, Claude, a rival to ChatGPT, is designed to be ethical and less likely to produce responses that could encourage dangerous behaviour.

Our Chart of the Day comes from Apollo Global Management and demonstrates the widening performance gap between the S&P 500's top seven stocks and all its other listed equities.
While the leading firms have rocketed more than 50% this year, the remaining 493 equities have stayed ""basically flat,"" Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Sløk wrote on Saturday.
Specifically, they've risen about 5% through the year. The overall S&P 500, which is weighted by market cap, is up over 13% for the year.
""The bottom line is that if you buy the S&P 500 today, you are basically buying a handful of companies that make up 34% of the index and have an average P/E ratio around 50,"" he wrote.
Known as the ""Magnificent 7,"" the massive gains seen by Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Tesla were sparked by hype over artificial intelligence.
On Monday, Amazon said it will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company that's considered a rival to ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which counts Microsoft as a top investor.
The AI-led stock rally has acted as a counterweight to equity headwinds this year, whether they be rising interest rates or last spring's banking turmoil.
But the past two months have seen the seven stocks pare some gains after climbing nearly 70% at its mid-July peak. This month, top performer Nvidia was not spared from bearish sentiments, and has lost $180 billion in market capitalization.
That's in part as soaring bond yields now offer a profitable alternative to the equity market, while declining consumer savings and a cooling labor market make further growth uncertain.
But excitement for the cohort still remains among Wall Street observers. Last week, Wedbush Securities noted that the tech sector is estimated to boost spending over the next 12-18 months, helping the rally overcome further headwinds.","CHART OF THE DAY: The S&P 500's top 7 stocks have soared more than 50% in 2023, while everything else is 'basically flat'",422.22,419.10999,424.67999,9,2023,26

That’s according to Morgan Stanley, which argues that concerns about demand sustainability for Nvidia’s chips used in artificial intelligence computing will soon be quelled by management comments or financial results. That will make the stock’s decline of 15% in September an excellent buying opportunity, analysts led by Joseph Moore said.
“Numbers are likely to continue to be strong, and to the extent that investors are concerned about near term demand that’s a good thing, as it is a negative thesis that the company can quickly disprove,” the analysts wrote in a research note on Monday.
Shares of Nvidia fell 0.6% on Tuesday.
Nvidia’s valuation has become a subject of intense debate among investment professionals after its stock tripled this year amid soaring demand from customers rushing to beef up AI computing capacity. While Wall Street analysts are nearly universally bullish, skeptics like Rob Arnott, founder of Research Affiliates LLC, argue that Nvidia is priced so high that it can’t possibly live up to expectations. It’s even too expensive for Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood.
The selloff in Nvidia comes as technology stocks are under pressure from rising Treasury yields, with the Federal Reserve signaling its willingness to keep interest rates high to combat inflation. Still, Nvidia has fallen much more than the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index, which is down 5.4% this month.
The stock’s decline combined with rising profit estimates have pushed Nvidia’s valuation to the cheapest in nearly a year. At 28 times profits projected over the next 12 months, Nvidia is half as expensive as it was in May, before the first of its two consecutive blow-out earnings reports and below the stock’s average of 32 times over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Of course, that places a lot of faith in estimates, which have been jumping at a breakneck pace. The average analyst projection for earnings per share in Nvidia’s fiscal 2025, which ends on Jan. 31, 2025, has more than tripled in the past six months.
That hasn’t deterred Thomas George, portfolio manager at Grizzle Investment Management, which counts Nvidia among its top holdings.
“Nvidia is really reasonably priced for the growth it is generating,” George said in an interview. “In a few years, you’ll look back and see it as very attractively priced right now. The demand isn’t a mirage.”
For some investors, Nvidia’s failure to rally after beating second quarter sales estimates by more than $2 billion in August is a sign that the stock has priced in a lot of future growth despite faltering momentum.
But analysts have only gotten more bullish since then with the average price target for Nvidia rising to $646, implying a gain of more than 50%. With the stock’s retreat, the gap between expectations and current share price is close to the widest on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tech Chart of the Day
The Nasdaq 100 Index’s recent pullback has brought valuations lower, but with yields on the rise, it’s still quite pricey. On a forward price-to-sales basis, the tech-heavy index trades at 3.8 times, as of its last close, well above its 10-year average, indicating that the frothiness is still there.

With the aim to advance generative AI development, the strategic partnership will make Amazon Web Services the startup’s primary cloud provider while AWS customers will gain early access to unique features for model customization along with fine-tuning capabilities from Anthropic who was founded by former OpenAI research executives. Anthropic recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2 and is Amazon’s latest conquest as it continues competing against Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) in AI development.
The Deal Is More About Chip Development Than Chatbot Rivalry
San Francisco-based Anthropic has its own AI chatbot that rivals that of Microsoft-backed ChatGPT. Released in July, Claude 2 will help AWS customers to develop new generative AI-powered applications that have the power to completely transform their organizations. But, more importantly, Anthropic and Amazon agreed to develop the next set of chips together with Anthropic agreeing to use Amazon’s chips to develop its future models. Therefore, the bigger picture is about a power shift on the AI chip front, maybe not in a year, but in about five years, this deal could power Amazon to dramatically change yet another competitive landscape.
Challenging Nvidia, The AI Chip King
Moreover, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that alternative chips can be used for fueling AI, therefore, challenging the dominance of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). The key product of Nvidia is a GPU, semiconductor that is used to train large AI models. With the AI hype, Nvidia smashed financial forecasts, but that may no longer be the case in the future as Amazon clearly showed its intention of developing customized AWS chips. Nvidia is currently the undebatable AI winner simply because it got into it long before anyone else.
Tech Giants And Their AI Ambitions
Big Tech is increasingly entering collaborations with smaller AI firms. Although Microsoft led the way with its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, Amazon just swooped up a AI hotspot, simultaneously beating Google who was an early investor in Anthropic with the AI startup announcing only seven months ago that it had selected Google as its cloud provider. But Amazon does not have a record of chasing markets but rather creating them. Therefore, only time will show Amazon’s new creation and contribution to the AI future in-the-making.

NVDA,2023-09-26 18:17:18,"The S&P 500 could tank 20%, a wave of loan defaults could hit banks and commercial real estate, and a recession could set in next year, Byron Wien says.","Stocks, real estate, banks, and the economy may be in danger, Byron Wien has warned.
Earnings weakness could tank the S&P 500 by 10% or 20%, the Blackstone executive said.
Wien sees a risk of recession, and higher rates hitting commercial real estate and bank lending.
Stocks, real estate, banks, and the wider US economy are all flashing warning signs, one of Wall Street's leading strategists says.
""Everything that I'm looking at makes me think that there is trouble ahead,"" Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone's private wealth solutions arm, said during a recent Rosenberg Research webcast. ""And if I'm right about that, then the market is dangerous.""
Wien, who spent 21 years as Morgan Stanley's top US investment strategist, is known for his annual list of ""surprises"" for the year ahead. He reeled off a laundry list of concerns to veteran economist David Rosenberg during their conversation.
They included the fact that stocks have outperformed bonds during a period when interest rates have risen sharply, and a handful of stocks including Tesla and Nvidia are responsible for most of the market's gains this year.
Wien also flagged slowing employment growth, the prospect of less demand for US exports as the European and Chinese economies weaken, and the likelihood that the US government will have to raise taxes and siphon liquidity out of the stock market and economy to cover the interest costs of its ballooning debt.
Moreover, he flagged the threat of stubborn inflation, rising gas prices, high mortgage rates stifling housing-market activity, dwindling consumer savings, and the resumption of student-loan repayments in October.
On the stocks front, Wien predicted a ""double whammy"" of shrinking valuation multiples and disappointing earnings next year will hit the market. He suggested the S&P 500 could tumble by 10% or 20% from its current level.
The Blackstone executive also sounded the alarm on the commercial real estate and banking industries. He noted the remote-working and e-commerce booms threaten to pull down property values, and steeper interest rates could spark a rise in loan defaults that might deter banks from lending and depress economic growth.
""I'm actually worried that there are going to be a lot of defaults out there,"" Wien said. ""The major money-center banks will be challenged, and the regional banks will run into more trouble. That will put a strain on the financial system. So that's a serious problem.""
Wien also underscored that a recession could strike late next year, and warned the market will likely weaken once investors start pricing in that risk. He cautioned the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates until it's confident inflation will slow to its target rate of 2%, and the central bank might have to hike rates a couple more times before it's satisfied.
""I'm still worried that there is more tightening ahead,"" he said. ""I'm worried that we are going to have a recession, and I'm worried that inflation is not licked.""
Wien pointed to recent declines in leading economic indicators, dwindling bank liquidity, and the rise in mortgage rates as three big reasons why he's concerned about a recession.
He also issued a bleak outlook for the coming decade, predicting ""very low growth in the next 10 years, with stocks only rising due to earnings growing, not multiples expanding.""
The veteran strategist recommended investors play it safe by locking in a roughly 5% annual return from a money-market fund or 10-year US Treasury, and only turn bullish on stocks when the trading backdrop improves. He singled out commodities, fossil fuels, and some emerging markets as other good bets.","Stocks, banks, and real estate are headed for trouble - and a recession is still looming, Wall Street legend Byron Wien warns",422.22,419.10999,424.67999,9,2023,26
NVDA,2023-09-28 10:00:05,Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott didn't completely dispel rumors about the tech giant developing its own AI chips.,"Microsoft (MSFT) didn't deny that it's looking at making its own chips.
For some time, rumors have swirled that Microsoft, like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), is pursuing a chip solution that would make it less dependent on chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA).
At the 2023 Code Conference in Dana Point, California, Microsoft's chief technology officer and executive vice president of AI Kevin Scott stayed mum on those rumors, but he did offer some color on how Microsoft, arguably the AI leader right now, is thinking about chips.
""I'm not confirming anything,"" he told the audience. ""I will say that we've got a pretty substantial silicon investment that we've had for years. The thing that we will do is make sure we're making the best choices for how we build these systems, using whatever options are available. And the best option over the last few years, it's been Nvidia.""
Scott was also cagey about whether Microsoft would ever move on or diversify away from its Nvidia partnership, such as by pursuing chips from AMD (AMD).
But he did say that, from the customer perspective, it shouldn't make a difference where the chips powering their AI experiences come from.
""For us, it's a big complicated software stack, but the only part the customer sees is the API interface,"" he told the audience.
Though the industry is in the midst of a headline-making AI chip shortage, Scott was optimistic about the chips that are out there right now and the trajectory that the technology is on.
""Chips are getting better price [and] performance-wise generation over generation,"" Scott said, adding: ""The software techniques that we're using to optimize the models are bringing tons of performance without compromise to quality.""

As it prepares to ramp up production of new product lines, Micron also revealed it is working to become a supplier to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) but even its better-than-expected results were overshadowed by the first quarter loss forecast and a later than anticipated return to a positive gross margin, sending its shares down about 5% in premarket trading on Thursday.
Nvidia Could Support Micron’s Recovery
Increasing demand for high-bandwidth memory chips for AI use, a market that is led by SK Hynix who supplies Nvidia has raised hopes of Micron weathering a slow recovery in other end markets. Micron further sparked this hope by announcing a supply deal with Nvidia that is dominating the field as its chips became crucial for AI development and fueled its stock to rise 187% year to date. The AI market is estimated to be worth $137 billion and expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through the end of the decade and Nvidia holds a majority market share in GPUs, graphics processing units that are necessary for AI development. Nvidia is the place for powerful hardware that powers AI with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) far behind in their offerings despite their efforts to catch up. During its second quarter that ended in July, Nvidia reported a 101% YoY revenue rise fueled by a 171% expansion in data center revenue. Moreover, Nvidia is expected to deliver even bigger gains in the undergoing quarter as supply challenges got resolved more quickly than anticipated.
Fiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights
Micron reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.01 billion, topping Street estimates of $3.91 billion but still marking a 40% drop due to the ""security review"" by China's Cyberspace Administration. It also posted a narrower-than-expected loss as non-GAAP loss for the quarter that ended in August amounted to $1.07 per share.
A Mixed Guidance
For the undergoing quarter, Micron expects adjusted revenue to be approximately $4.40 billion, plus or minus $200 million, topping LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, estimates of $4.20 billion. But the adjusted loss per share has been guided at $1.07 which is worse than 95 cents that LSEG gathered analysts estimated.
However, during the conference call, Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra emphasized that next year’s revenue will be getting a ‘several hundred million’ influx from the company’s new high-bandwidth chips. However, the market didn’t forgive Micron for expecting a positive gross margin in the second half of fiscal 2024 as Wall Street was expecting its return during the first half. But as Sumit Sadana, Micron Chief Business Officer, put it, Micron simply made a bet on higher-performing chips and it needs to wait till next year for them to start paying off.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A raid by French authorities of the offices of a technology firm named as Nvidia in media reports is the latest among a string of such actions by European regulators as they look to check the dominance of Big Tech companies from thwarting competition.
The French competition authority conducted the dawn raid on Wednesday on a company in the ""graphics cards sector"", it said. French newspaper Challenges and the Wall Street Journal identified the company as Nvidia.
Nvidia has declined to comment, while the French competition authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
WHY IS NVIDIA IMPORTANT?
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that break down a computer task into smaller pieces and processes them together, making it faster than traditional methods.
The GPUs are highly sought by technology companies for their data centres, by video game console makers and even by bitcoin miners to solve the complex math puzzles and earn more cryptocurrencies.
Nvidia has a near-monopoly of the GPU market with 84% market share, leagues ahead of rivals Intel and AMD. With a market valuation of $1 trillion, Nvidia is also becoming crucial to fast-developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
Almost all computing systems used to power services like ChatGPT - OpenAI's blockbuster generative AI chatbot - use GPUs from Nvidia.
While GPU prices start from over $1,000, the ones favored by AI companies can cost well over $10,000. Specialized AI systems from Nvidia such as DGX A100 start at $199,000, or the price of four Tesla Model 3s.
Oracle, for example, said it has been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia chips.
WHY IS FRANCE INTERESTED?
The French Competition Authority (FCA) earlier this year issued a report on the competitive functioning of the cloud computing sector.
It was looking at the market dominance of cloud companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft and whether their market dominance affect competition.
In that report, the authority also highlighted that several developments, such as large language models and cloud gaming, would potentially have an impact on the competitive functioning of the sector.
Nvidia has a presence in both sectors, and if any startup is planning to create an AI company, they would need to depend on Nvidia for the chips.
The FCA carried out an unannounced visit and seizure at the premises after authorisation from a judge. Whether the company implemented anti-competitive practices could only be established by an investigation on the merits, it said.
""In terms of next steps after the initial raid, there will most likely be court proceedings against the raid itself and the order of the judge having authorised the raid,"" said Charlotte Colin-Dubuisson, antitrust and foreign investment partner at law firm Linklaters.
In France, this is a separate proceeding before court, and can have an impact on the FCA's case if the raid and/or the order is invalidated, Colin-Dubuisson said.
IS THE FCA INVESTIGATING OTHERS?
Various French authorities have looked at Big Tech companies previously, including issuing a fine to Google in 2021 for infringing EU competition law.
The FCA is examining whether the competitors of big cloud companies are facing any obstacles.
The authority has tools to protect competition under the law of abuse of a dominant position, the law of cartels, abuse of economic dependence and concentration control, and the law on restrictive competition practices.
It also thinks that some market failures would likely be addressed by regulations currently under discussion, such as the proposed EU Data Act.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Surging bond yields are rattling U.S. stocks, and some investors worry the richly valued shares of giant technology and growth companies may be another weak spot.
Seven megacap stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms — have led broader markets higher this year. As of Tuesday, these stocks accounted for more than 80% of the S&P 500's total return for 2023.
Investors see many of the stocks as major beneficiaries of advances in artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, megacaps' strong balance sheets and business models also attracted those looking for a safe haven when regional banking turmoil shook the financial system.
Their rising stock prices ballooned valuations, however, and some investors say the megacaps could be vulnerable if climbing bond yields keep pressuring stocks. The so-called Magnificent Seven stocks trade at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 31.8 based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to LSEG Datastream. That far surpasses the S&P 500's ratio of 18.1.
With a collective weighting of 27% in the S&P 500, weakness in the megacaps could further deflate the broader index, now down 6.6% from its July highs, investors said. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up over 11%.
""When the big tech stocks start going down ... the indexes go down,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. ""Then people get nervous and sell their mutual funds or their ETFs, and ... the whole thing snowballs.”
The recent stock selloff has already dented some megacaps, with Apple — the largest company by market value — dropping about 13% since late July. High-flier Nvidia fell nearly 12% in September. Apple remains up 32% for the year, with Nvidia up nearly 200%.
PRESSURE FROM YIELDS
Higher yields on Treasuries - which are sensitive to rate expectations and seen as risk free - offer more investment competition to stocks while raising the cost of borrowing for corporations and households.
The yield on the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury stands near its highest level in around 16 years on worries that the Federal Reserve will leave rates around current levels longer than previously expected.
Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.
“Because (the megacaps) are more highly valued, that just means that they are going to be more sensitive to changes in real interest rates,” said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co.
Options markets show elevated concern among investors. Thirty-day implied volatility for the Nasdaq-100-tracking Invesco QQQ ETF - a measure of how much traders expect the shares to gyrate in the near term - recently climbed to 22, the highest since mid-April, according to options analytics service Trade Alert.
Still, strategists point out that the rise in implied volatility for tech stocks is no more than for the broader market. That sense of complacency makes tech stocks vulnerable to increased volatility should market declines accelerate from here, said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna Financial Group co-head of derivative strategy.
To be sure, some megacap stocks have held up relatively well in the S&P 500's latest slide, including Alphabet, whose shares are down only slightly since late July.
The Nasdaq 100, a proxy for a broader swath of big tech and growth stocks, has fallen roughly in line with the S&P 500 since late July and remains up some 35% this year. It is down 7% from its highs.
Investors also see other risks for megacap stocks.
A U.S. antitrust lawsuit filed this week against Amazon created a “new line of worry in the megacap space,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey.
And while optimism about increased use of AI applications has helped tech stocks this year, there is some question about the ultimate boost to profits, said J. Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management.
""The whole promise of AI hasn’t... reached fruition yet,” Evans said.

The chipmaker has surged another 73% since, powered higher by a surge in demand for its semiconductors.
""I'm going to be putting a hex curse on that stock,"" Hsu joked.
The head of a quant trading fund told his mom to sell her Nvidia shares when they were trading at just 60% of their current price – and hasn't heard the end of it since.
Speaking to Bloomberg's ""What Goes Up"" podcast last week, Rayliant Global Advisors founder and CIO Jason Hsu admitted he'd talked his mother into offloading the stock at $250.
Nvidia last traded at that level in mid-March and has climbed another 73% since, taking its total gains for the year to a staggering 198%, as of Friday's closing bell.
""I told my mom, 'Sell Nvidia, you made such a good gain.' And of course then it goes to like $450,"" Hsu said.
""So every time my mom sees me, she's like, 'I have an idiot for a son. Did you go to school? Did you actually go to school and get a PhD in finance? What is wrong with you?'""
""Until Nvidia falls below $250, I'm going to be putting a hex curse on that stock,"" he joked.
Nvidia has been one of the biggest success stock-market success stories of 2023, with a massive AI-fueled surge in demand for its semiconductors helping it to post blowout earnings reports for both the first and second quarters.
Hsu, whose firm Rayliant manages $17 billion worth of assets, isn't alone in thinking that the chipmaker's shares may have become overvalued.

NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 were lower on Monday with utilities falling sharply, while the Nasdaq was barely changed as investors weighed the likelihood the Federal Reserve will need to hold interest rates higher for longer.
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she remains willing to support another increase in the central bank's policy interest rate at a future meeting if upcoming data shows progress on inflation is stalling or proceeding too slowly.
The U.S. central bank said last month it may hike rates again as it struggles to bring inflation closer to its 2% annual target.
""We ended September with a market that was enveloped by uncertainty. Coming into this month, it's a market that needs confirmation that earnings are working their way higher ... and that needs to ascertain where the Fed is headed,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Investors continue to keep a close eye on rising Treasury yields, she said, but the advance on Monday was tied to an agreement to avert a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced demand for the debt before this week's key jobs data.
Rate-sensitive utilities was the day's worst-performing S&P sector, down 5.3% in afternoon trading, on course for its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 2020.
Energy also fell sharply, while technology was up 0.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 207.04 points, or 0.62%, to 33,300.46, the S&P 500 lost 23.23 points, or 0.54%, to 4,264.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.85 points, or 0.07%, at 13,228.17.

NVDA,2023-10-02 23:16:56,Wall Street's worries about sticky inflation and the Fed's interest-rate hikes fueled big losses for both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite last month.,"Stocks had their worst month of 2023 in September. The S&P 500 fell 5% and the Nasdaq dropped 6%.
Wall Street's worries about sticky inflation and the Fed's interest-rate hikes drove those losses.
These four charts sum up a rough month for the market.
US investors are nursing their wounds as the fourth quarter rolls in, after a bruising September took some of the shine off this year's stock-market rally.
The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 5% in its worst month of the year, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 6% and 4% respectively.
It's the second month in a row that each of the US's big three indices have posted losses – and even the ""Magnificent Seven"" weren't able to deliver returns for their shareholders.
The group of mega-cap stocks – made up of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – powered much of the market's gains over the first half of 2023, but struggled in September.
Of the seven Big Tech giants, only Meta and Tesla were able to finish the month in the green.
Meanwhile, Apple and Nvidia had dismal months, with both stocks plunging 10% to wipe hundreds of billions of dollars off their total valuations.
The end of the third quarter does tend to be a miserable time for stocks – leading to traders coining the term ""September Effect"".
2023 marked the fourth year in a row that the S&P 500 logged losses in September, per data from Deutsche Bank.
Rather than some sort of pre-Halloween hex, oil and the Federal Reserve were the two factors that drove US equities' miserable month, analysts said.
""The declines had several causes, but an important one was the growing sense that central banks were likely to keep interest rates higher for longer, alongside a $20 a barrel rise in oil prices over the quarter,"" macro strategist Henry Allen wrote in a research note Monday.
In September, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pledged to stay vigilant on inflation, which has slowed in 2023 but is still running ahead of the central bank's 2% target.
Traders now only expect interest rates to start falling in the second half of 2024, per the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Higher borrowing costs tend to be bad news for stocks, because they boost the relative appeal of low-risk, low-return assets like bonds and cash.
You can sum up Wall Street's renewed worries about the Fed by looking at how the US Dollar Index performed in September.
Unlike stocks, the greenback tends to perform well when interest rates are expected to rise or remain high, because it becomes more attractive to foreign investors seeking juicier yields.
The gauge, which tracks the dollar's strength against six other currencies, climbed 2% in September to hit a fresh 2023 high.
It's now on an 11-week winning streak, with investors betting the Fed's inflation fight is nowhere near over.
Oil is one reason that those same investors are becoming more and more certain that the battle against soaring prices isn't done yet.
Benchmark Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices climbed by a fifth over the third quarter.
Each topped $90 a barrel toward the end of September, before giving up some of their gains at the end of the month. Higher benchmark oil prices tend to be bad news for inflation gauges, because they have the knock-on effect of driving up the cost of everyday products – especially gasoline.
Those four charts tell the story of another miserable September, when the worries that doomed stocks in 2022 – red-hot inflation, the Fed's aggressive rate hikes, a rampant dollar, and soaring commodity costs – came to the fore once again.",Stocks just had their worst month of the year as the 'September Effect' set in.

NVDA,2023-10-03 00:35:38,"While mega-cap tech stocks are the cheapest since 2017, the upcoming earnings season is a catalyst for further growth, Goldman Sachs wrote.","Mega-cap stocks are at their cheapest valuation in six years, Goldman Sachs wrote.
Meanwhile, they're earnings season will outperform the typical S&P firm.
The sector is likely to keep outperforming the index through at least 2025.
Mega-cap tech stocks are not only set to reverse their current downturn, they're likely to continue outperforming the broader market for years to come, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note published Sunday.
While the sector's seven leading equities have dropped 20% from their July peak, they're now trading 1.3x higher than their price, earnings per share, and long term growth (PEG), below the average S&P stock's 1.9x ratio. It's a level reached only five times in the past decade, and the largest discount since 2017.
""As recently as January, the group commanded an 18% PEG premium to the median stock (2.2x vs. 1.9x). If consensus growth estimates remain unchanged and the mega-cap tech stocks trade back to their average PEG of the last decade (0.84x), the group would appreciate by 20%,"" Goldman said.
This could happen soon, with the upcoming earnings season likely to be a possible catalyst for more gains in the sector. For two-thirds of the earnings seasons since 2016, leading tech equities have led earnings by three percentage points.
And today's top tech names — Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta, also known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" — are expected to see 11% sales growth in the upcoming third quarter results, compared to an estimated 1% for the aggregate S&P 500.
Not only could this boost the tech industry back to 2023 highs, it could help the sector continue outpacing the average S&P 500 stock throughout the next few years.
That's as superior sales growth has been a long-standing trend for mega-cap tech, even before artificial intelligence hype drove a massive surge in their share price. For instance, from 2013 to 2019, the sector increased at a 15% compound annual growth rate, compared to 2% for the rest of the S&P.
Through 2025, the top seven stocks are projected to grow nine percentage points faster than the remainder of the index.
Apart from high hopes for a strong earnings season, mega-cap tech stocks should also rebound amid moderation in the US Treasury market. The sector largely fell off as 10-year yields have shot past 4.6%, but Goldman estimates they will drop back down to 4.3% in the fourth quarter.
""The divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors,"" the note said.
Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives holds similar optimism for the tech sector. In a recent note, referred to the upcoming earnings as a ""sneak preview"" of tech's future growth. Yet, not everyone believes the rally is sustainable, and some commentators have warned that sticky inflation and fading AI hype will disrupt further gains in the sector.","Top tech stocks are trading at the biggest relative discount in over 6 years with earnings set to spark momentum, Goldman Sachs says",447.82001,435.17001,440.41,10,2023,3

EUROPEAN UNION
Microsoft said in August it would unbundle chat and video app Teams from its Office product in a bid to avoid a possible EU antitrust fine, a month after the European Commission launched an investigation into its Office and Teams tie-up.
Meta Platforms offered in July to curb the use of competitors' advertising data for its Facebook Marketplace online classified service in an attempt to settle an EU antitrust investigation but regulators rebuffed it, people familiar with the matter said.
In May, Meta was hit with a record 1.2-billion euro ($1.27 billion) fine by the EU's lead privacy regulator for its handling of user information and given five months to stop transferring users' data to the United States.
EU regulators said in June that Alphabet's Google may have to sell part of its adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices, threatening the company with its harshest regulatory penalty to date.
The EU competition watchdog last year accused Apple of restricting rivals' access to its tap-and-go technology, NFC, used for mobile wallets, making it difficult for them to develop rival services on Apple devices. The regulators have since continued their investigation.
In December 2022, Amazon settled three antitrust probes after it addressed the EU's concerns over its use of sellers' data.
In September, the EU picked out 22 so-called ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of its wide-ranging Digital Markets Act (DMA).
BRITAIN
Britain's communications regulator said in April it would ask the UK competition watchdog to investigate Amazon and Microsoft, saying some aspects of the market, including fees to switch supplier, were a cause for concern.
FRANCE
The French competition authority raided Nvidia's local offices in the last week of September, the Wall Street Journal reported. The watchdog disclosed the raid on Sept. 27, but did not name the company beyond saying it was in the ""graphics cards sector"".
Nvidia declined to comment.
The antitrust authority in July said Apple may have violated regulations related to the utilisation of iPhone user data in advertising and could potentially misuse its dominant market position by imposing biased, unclear, and unfair conditions to handle user data.
The country's privacy watchdog said in July it was aware of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's Worldcoin crypto project and that the legality of its biometric data collection ""seems questionable as do the conditions for storing biometric data"".
GERMANY
A German data watchdog has been investigating Worldcoin since late 2022. Worldcoin, which launched in July 2023, requires users to give their iris scans in exchange for a digital ID and, in some countries, free cryptocurrency.
ITALY
Italy's antitrust agency said in May it had opened a probe into Apple for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the apps market.
In April, the watchdog took measures against Meta over an alleged abuse of its position in the country, in a probe involving the rights to music posted on the group's platforms.
OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot was temporarily banned in Italy in March over concerns by the national data protection authority, but was made available to users again in April.
The antitrust authority said in March it had opened an investigation into TikTok for allegedly breaching its rules by allowing the publication of ""dangerous content"" inciting suicide, self-harm and poor nutrition.
NETHERLANDS
The Dutch competition regulator on Oct. 2 said it had rejected Apple's objections against fines of 50 million euros it had given the company over failure to comply with regulations aimed at limiting the dominant position of Apple's App Store. Apple will appeal the decision in Dutch courts.
POLAND
A Polish watchdog said in September it was investigating OpenAI over a complaint that ChatGPT breaks European Union data protection laws.
Poland's competition and consumer protection authority in February accused Amazon's European arm of misleading sales and delivery practices.
SPAIN
Spain's antitrust watchdog in July fined Amazon and Apple for colluding to limit the online sale of devices from Apple and competitors in the country.

Economic data releases and earnings
Throwing the word ""AI"" around isn't what it used to be.
The biggest names in tech drove the stock market's surge this year, pivoting from the cold afterglow of cost-cutting layoffs to riding high on the exuberance of AI.
But the mega-cap stocks that led the way won't be what takes the S&P 500 higher on its next journey upward. It will be the other 493 companies with much lower valuations but higher potential to outperform, analysts say, without the baggage of inflated valuations or the pain from the tumble after the AI run-up.
Opportunities for value stocks, cyclicals, and beaten-down industries lie in the S&P's weighting.
The market caps of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META) — account for 28% of the index, highlighting how top-heavy the index has become.
The S&P 500 is essentially a high school basketball team right now with a few 6-footers and a lot of 5-foot-3 kids. The stocks that haven't had a growth spurt yet are in a good position to contest for Most Improved Player.
As tech stocks slid, so did the index. The S&P in September suffered its worst performing month so far this year. But those losses could inspire smaller-cap stocks to flourish, as my colleague Josh Schafer reports, with gains spread in a more healthy distribution across the market, instead of in a concentrated few.
Still, even as analysts see smaller names eventually leading the charge on Wall Street, when that rotation will arrive is less clear. Unlike that basketball team, there are no guarantees of growth spurts and a stock can have more than one.
SoFi head of investment strategy Liz Young said she thinks the shift to smaller-cap stocks could be underway, but she doesn't see a next leg higher for the S&P 500 on the ""imminent horizon."" Valuations for Big Tech and the broader S&P still have further to fall, she believes, before a slowdown kicks off a new business cycle with a new roster of names posting the biggest gains.
Others don't predict a slowdown, but still see a viable path for smaller stocks to drive the market.
Bank of America's research team, for instance, bucked what had been a prevailing and protracted narrative of an impending contraction and removed its recession call in early August. The equity strategy team led by Savita Subramanian sees the S&P rising to 4,600 by the end of the of the year.
That's a 7% increase from where the benchmark index closed in September. But while analysts disagree over timing, there's the sense that the mega cap stocks will take a back seat.
The Bank of America team noted their ""highest conviction call"" remains that the equal-weighted S&P 500, which strips out the market cap weighting of stocks, will outperform the standard S&P 500 index and its heavy skew to the Magnificent Seven.
""We think cyclicals are the next leg where this market really could potentially reside,"" Bank of America equity & quant strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance. ""Basically it's the complete opposite of what worked earlier this year.""

Troubled property developer China Evergrande was down 11% after plunging 28% on Tuesday.,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian markets were sharply lower on Wednesday after Wall Street tumbled as it focused on the downside of a surprisingly strong job market: the likelihood that interest rates will stay high.
U.S. futures and oil prices edged lower.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index sank 2.3% to 30,526.88 and the Kospi in South Korea dropped 2.4% to 2,405.69.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng skidded 1.3% to 17,115.62. Troubled property developer China Evergrande was down 11% after plunging 28% on Tuesday.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.8% to 6,890.20. In Bangkok, the SET recovered from early losses, gaining 0.4%.
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 lost 1.4% to 4,229.45. The Dow sank 1.3% to 33,002.38, wiping out the last of its gains for the year so far. The Nasdaq composite led the market lower with a 1.9% drop to 13,059.47 as Big Tech stocks were among the market’s biggest losers.
Amazon fell 3.7%, Microsoft dropped 2.6% and Nvidia lost 2.8%.
The Dow is down 0.4% for the year so far, after being up nearly 8% at the start of August. The S&P 500, which is the index more 401(k) investments are benchmarked against, has sliced its gain for the year so far to 10.2%.
Stocks fell after a report showed U.S. employers have many more job openings than expected. Expectations that interest rates will stay high are pressuring stocks as Treasury yields rise in the bond market.
Such weight has been the main reason the S&P 500 has lost more than 40% of its value since the end of July, after charging higher for much of the year.
The 10-year Treasury yield climbed Tuesday to 4.79% from 4.69% late Monday and from just 0.50% early in the pandemic. It touched its highest level since 2007.
When bonds are paying so much more in interest, they pull investment dollars away from stocks and other investments prone to bigger price swings than bonds. High yields also make borrowing more expensive for companies and households across the economy, which can hurt corporate profits.
Investors increasingly are taking the Federal Reserve at its word that it will keep its main interest rate high for a long time in order to drive down inflation. The Fed has already yanked its federal funds rate to the highest level since 2001, and it indicated last month it may keep the rate higher in 2024 than it earlier expected.
Tuesday's report showed employers were advertising 9.6 million job openings in late August, much higher than the 8.9 million economists expected. That could keep upward pressure on wages to attract employees.
Several other challenges are also tugging at Wall Street besides higher yields. The resumption of student-loan repayments could drag on spending by U.S. households, which has been strong enough to help keep the economy out of a recession despite high interest rates. Higher oil prices are threatening to worsen inflation, and economies around the world look shaky.
Oil prices ticked higher a day after slumping sharply to trim their big gains since the summer.
A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude lost 43 cents to $88.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 41 cents to settle at $89.23 on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 40 cents to $90.52 per barrel.
The dollar rose to 149.22 Japanese yen from 149.04 yen. The yen's weakness against the dollar has drawn protests from Japanese officials, and analysts said they believed regulators had intervened Tuesday to prevent the dollar from surpassing the 150 yen level.
The government did not confirm if it had acted to support the yen. However, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told reporters that rapid currency moves were “undesirable.” He said Japan was prepared to respond appropriately, with “all options on the table.”

According to Forbes, the amount of wealth the top 20 have is so massive they could ""buy the bottom 340 billionaires ranking on the list — with billions to spare."" While this is one way to visualize their wealth, it also highlights the difference in financial stature even among America's richest.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a significant factor in shaping the fortunes of America's elite. Oracle Corp. Co-Founder Larry Ellison experienced a notable increase in his wealth, amounting to $57 billion. This surge, largely the result of Oracle's 69% stock appreciation, elevated him to the No. 3 spot on America’s wealthiest list.
Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also made big strides this year. His reentry into the top 10 of the Forbes 400 list can be credited to Meta's strategic adoption of AI and its new initiatives.
Google Co-Founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin also rode the AI wave. With parent company Alphabet Inc. introducing innovative AI tools, its stock enjoyed a 27% boost. This success has positioned both Page and Brin in the Forbes top 10.

(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chipmaker Graphcore said it needed to raise cash due to widening losses, according to a filing, as Nvidia's dominance in AI chips has chilled funding for startups looking to compete directly.
Graphcore produces AI chips called intelligence processor units (IPUs) that aim to take on Nvidia. It reported pre-tax losses widened 11% to $204.6 million, according to a filing of its 2022 financial statements filed Wednesday. Revenue declined 46% to $2.7 million.
According to a forecast the company made through 2027, Graphcore will need to raise more cash to break even, the filing said. The company is in talks with investors to raise money but has not reached an agreement.
A spokesperson for Graphcore declined to comment on its fundraising activity.
""We're thrilled with the results that we were able to deliver in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness compared to GPUs which set us up for commercial success in coming years,"" Graphcore spokesperson Iain Mackenzie said in a statement.
Nvidia's dominance in AI has made it more difficult for startups to access capital, as investors are less willing to make large bets on companies that compete head on.
The chipmaker closed operations in Norway, Japan, and South Korea and scaled back operations in other countries, according to the filing. The company's headcount dropped to 494, down 21% from a year earlier, the filing said.
Graphcore has raised $711.8 million at a $2.77 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.

SAN FRANCISCO/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Tech companies operating in Israel are expected to fortify security as they could face disruptions, said investors and analysts, after Hamas gunmen from Gaza killed hundreds of Israelis and abducted an unknown number of others.
High-tech industries have for a few decades been the fastest growing sector in Israel and crucial for economic growth, accounting for 14% of jobs and almost a fifth of gross domestic product.
Israeli stock and bond prices slid and many businesses were closed on Sunday after gunmen from the Palestinian group Hamas rampaged through Israeli towns on Saturday and militants also fired thousands of rockets into Israel in a surprise attack.
Some rockets reached as far as Tel Aviv, prompting airlines to suspend flights to and from Israel.
Israel retaliated with air strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza, and hundreds of people have died.
""It is a huge disruption to business as usual,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors. He said in the short-term resources could be diverted if the conflict expands, such as staff at tech companies being called up as military reservists.
Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, said there will likely be a ""tremendous effort"" to guard physical installations for companies based in Israel from attacks because some technology spending is tied to the military.
A spokesperson for chipmaker Intel Corp, Israel's largest private employer and exporter, said on Sunday the company was ""closely monitoring the situation in Israel and taking steps to safeguard and support our workers."" The spokesperson declined to say whether chip production has been affected by the situation.
Nvidia, the world's largest maker of chips used for artificial intelligence and computer graphics, said it had canceled an AI summit scheduled for Tel Aviv next week, where its CEO Jensen Huang was due to speak.
Israel-based Tower Semiconductor, which provides customers with analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, mainly for the automotive and consumer industries, said it was operating as usual.
Other tech giants, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
Israel's technology sector had already been facing a slowdown in 2023, exacerbated by internal political conflict and protests. A growing number of Israel's tech startups have been incorporating in the United States.
MILITARY, AI SPENDING BOOST
Israel's tech sector dates back to 1974 when Intel established a presence, but the start-up scene took off in the 1990s, earning a reputation as the world's second-largest tech center outside of Silicon Valley, with thousands of companies and developing a significant ecosystem.
There are now 500 multinationals operating in Israel - mainly research and development centers after buying Israeli start-ups - from Intel to IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook.
In June, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Intel was planning to spend $25 billion on a new factory in the southern city of Kiryat Gat some 42 km (26 miles) from Gaza.
Due to open in 2027, he called it the largest-ever international investment in the country that could employ thousands of people and would add to its chip plants and design centers there.
In the longer term, the tech and AI sector, where Israel has been a leader, could see increased investment because of the industries' close tie-in with military spending, LPL's Krosby said.
""They will probably increase the investment in AI,"" Krosby said. ""When a country is caught literally off guard the first thing they look at - beside the obvious problems with intelligence - is what was missed within the security systems.""
""It could bolster support for more financial resources for tech for the military, which then ultimately transitions to the private sector tech companies,"" Krosby added.
The tech sector has shown resilience in the past, overcoming a number of conflicts with Hamas in Gaza.
Apjit Walia the Managing Director at DVN Capital said the Israeli tech sector ""has historically bounced back from geopolitical tragedies.""

An analyst firm is predicting a ""cold shower"" for generative AI in 2024.
CCS Insight, a London-based tech analytics firm, expects that the very real challenges of cost, risk, and complexity in AI could soon overshadow the technology's current hype in 2024, CNBC reported on Tuesday.
""The hype around generative AI in 2023 has just been so immense, that we think it's overhyped, and there's lots of obstacles that need to get through to bring it to market,"" Ben Wood, the chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC.
""Just the cost of deploying and sustaining generative AI is immense,"" said Wood. He added that while massive companies like Google and Meta can shoulder these costs, it would be too expensive for many organizations.
For context, AI relies on chips to run, and the firm's prediction comes amid concerns about a global chip shortage.
The importance of these chips has even ignited a global scramble for Nvidia's semiconductor chips among industry giants — ranging from Elon Musk to Chinese tech titans.
In response to the soaring demand, Nvidia, a trillion-dollar chipmaker, announced in August that it plans to triple the production of its $40,000 processor chips next year.
And AI company OpenAI is now exploring plans to make its own chips, Reuters reported on Friday, citing recent internal discussions at the company.

The new cash, which brings Prophecy's total capital raised to $67 million, will be put toward scaling the Prophecy platform and customer acquisition efforts, co-founder and CEO Raj Bains told TechCrunch in an email interview.
""The pandemic and economic slowdown had temporary slowdowns in buying software that lasted a couple of quarters each,"" Bains said. ""However, enterprise spend has held, and Prophecy is doubling revenue every two quarters despite these slowdowns -- putting us in a very strong position.""
Bains launched Prophecy after stints at Microsoft and Nvidia, where he worked on optimizing hardware performance and building the software infrastructure necessary to run AI compute workloads. After graduating to product manager of Apache Hive, an open source system for summarizing and analyzing data and querying data structures, Bains came to believe that the platforms on the market to transform data weren't adequate for today's AI and analytics projects.
""Data transformation has been identified as a bottleneck for two decades now,"" Bains said. ""Some organizations have tried to move to a code-only approach and hit a different set of challenges -- most importantly, that data analysts and other non-coders can no longer serve themselves.""
He might have a point.
According to a 2021 survey from Wakefield Research, revenue and decision-making often suffers when enterprises build their own data pipelines. Companies responding to the poll report a median of 12 data engineers who spend 44% of their time on data engineering at an average cost at $520,000 -- a significant capital and human resource investment by any measure.
A separate survey -- this one from cloud analytics software vendor Matillion -- found that data teams are overextending themselves to meet business demands. Eighty-four percent of data engineers responding to the poll described the volume of their workload as exceeding their capacity, while 34% said that it takes close to -- or over half -- of their workday to integrate, collect and transform data per project.
Prophecy's solution is what Bains calls ""visual development"" combined with code. The platform provides a drag-and-drop interface that customers can use to build code-based data pipelines with reliability guarantees, as well as what Prophecy refers to as ""packages"" -- reusable components containing business and operational logic plus code.
Prophecy leverages code and automation to make building data pipelines simpler. Image Credits: Prophecy
Prophecy, which is available as a fully managed cloud or on-premises service, also offers a tool, Data Copilot, that leverages large language models and an organization-specific knowledge graph to facilitate data transformations. Data Copilot builds data transformation pipelines from natural language prompts that describe a desired data transformation, eliminating the need to build them with code or the drag-and-drop editor. (Think OpenAI's ChatGPT, but for generating data pipelines.)
""Enterprise data has a productivity problem -- not enough data users are enabled to ship trusted data for analytics and AI,"" Bains said. ""Prophecy enables self-service data transformation for a broader class of users, especially non-coding data teams in the lines of business. The platform turns visual pipelines into open source code including PySpark, Scala or SQL, ensuring customers are never locked in and enabling best software practices through code.""
Prophecy has rivals in Coalesce, which offers data transformation tools geared mainly toward enterprise customers; Informatica and Talend; and Incorta and Etleap.
Fortunately, there's plenty of cash to go around in the market for data integration. Grand View Research predicts that the segment, which was worth $11.91 billion in 2022, will grow 12.3% from 2023 to 2030.
Bains claims that Prophecy, which has around 100 employees, is used by ""thousands"" of users across ""multiple"" Fortune 500 companies today, including banks, healthcare providers and tech vendors. Revenue has grown 400% year-over-year since Prophecy's Series A in January.
""Most customers start with buying software licenses for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the largest customers are over a million dollars,"" Bains said. ""Prophecy helps put analytics- and AI-ready data into more hands, more quickly -- speeding time to value and data-driven decision making. These are all advantages chief data officers typically care about.""

Blind put the list together after surveying 13,171 verified professionals in the US on its platform to assess the approval ratings of 104 CEOs.
Perceived job security was likely one of the most significant contributors to the CEO's approval ratings, according to Blind's October 4 announcement of the survey's results. Nine out of 10 CEOs in Blind's top 10 list did not lay off employees in the last year or more.
Meanwhile, some CEOs with the lowest approval ratings had cut jobs in 2023.
Here's the list of top five and bottom five CEOs in the survey, as ranked by Blind according to their approval ratings.
Representatives for all 10 CEOs did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment sent outside regular business hours.

Number of employees: 26,196 as of January 2023.
Jensen Huang, the cofounder CEO of California-based chipmaker Nvidia, is the corporate leader with the highest approval rating on the list.
Thanks to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, or AI, Nvidia's revenue and share price has surged to record highs this year — which likely boosted employee confidence in its leadership.

Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO in 2014, but actually started at the company when he was just a teenager.
McMillon joined the company in 1990 while completing his MBA as a buyer trainee in the athletic department at a local Walmart in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon after, he moved to Walmart's headquarters in Arkansas.
Since he became CEO, McMillion launched Walmart+, the company's equivalent of Amazon Prime. He has also updated Walmart's technology with new services such as drone delivery and the use of generative AI on its website.

Ali Ghodsi is the cofounder and CEO of tech company Databricks.
A Swedish national, Ghodsi fled Iran at the age of 5 in 1984 amid a political crackdown that implicated his parents. The upper-middle-class family had to leave their savings behind and faced financial difficulties when they reached Sweden, Ghodsi told Forbes in a May 2021 interview.
Still, Ghodsi eventually received a PhD in computer science from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, a top Swedish university. In 2009, he arrived in the US as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley.
Ghodsi stayed on in the US and started data and AI company Databricks with six other academics in 2013.
On September 14, Databricks announced it raised over $500 million in its latest round of funding, taking the company's valuation to $43 billion.
Here are the bottom five CEOs ranked by approval rating on Blind.
100. Evan Spiegel, Snap
Approval rating: 3%
Number of employees: Snap: 5,286 as of June 30, 2023.
The fifth-to-last name on Blind's list is Evan Spiegel, Snap's cofounder and CEO, who is a high-profile entrepreneur.
He launched the platform in 2011 and became one of the world's youngest billionaires four years later. The 33-year-old is now worth $2.5 billion, according to Forbes.
Snap is still one of the world's most well-known social media platforms but faces intense competition from rivals — such as TikTok.
In the last year, Snap was hit with sweeping layoffs, leadership changes, and project shutdowns as revenues slowed.
101. Mark Anderson, Alteryx
Approval rating: 3%
Number of employees: 2,600 as of June 30, 2023.
Mark Anderson became Alteryx's CEO in 2020. He was previously the president of Palo Alto Networks.
Alteryx, a data analytics software maker, announced plans to lay off 11% of its workforce in April this year.
The company's stock has fallen about 30% so far this year.
102. John Riccitiello, Unity Technologies
Approval rating: 2%
Number of employees: 7,700 as of May 2023.
John Riccitiello was the CEO of gaming software company Unity from 2014 to October 9 this year.
Riccitiello's retirement from the company followed changes in Unity's pricing in September that prompted protests from a consortium of game developers.
Roelof Botha, the lead independent director at Unity's board, said in the announcement of Riccitiello's retirement that the former CEO had helped Unity transition from a perpetual license to a subscription model during his tenure, which helped developers monetize and build other game services.
Riccitiello also oversaw Unity's IPO in 2020.
103. Erik Nordstrom, Nordstrom
Approval rating: 0%
Number of employees: 60,000 as of January 28, 2023.
Erik Nordstrom is one of the fourth generation of the family running the shopping empire.
The company was founded in 1901 by his great-grandfather John W. Nordstrom.
The company, like many of its legacy retail peers, faces stiff challenges in the business landscape, particularly from the rise of ecommerce.
In April, Nordstrom laid off an unknown number of employees in the department store chain's tech department.
Earlier this year, the department store announced it would shut its Canadian operations by late June, impacting about 2,500 job cuts.
104. David Goeckeler, Western Digital
Approval rating: 0%
Number of employees: 53,000 as of June 30, 2023.
At the bottom of Blind's list is David Goeckeler, who became the CEO of Western Digital, a data-storage company in 2020.

But what is driving the gains in these stocks? And do they still have more room to run in 2024 and beyond?
Here’s a look at some of the top performers in 2023, along with a brief analysis of what’s making them run and what their future prospects hold.
Nvidia (NVDA)
YTD gain as of Oct. 11: 220%
Nvidia has been the poster child of AI outperformance in 2023, gaining an incredible 220% this year. The producer of chips — known as GPUs — for gaming and other artificial intelligence seems well-positioned for future growth, with the company projecting 170% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 of its fiscal 2024.
The incredible rise of so-called “generative AI” like ChatGPT and other platforms this year bode well for growth at Nvidia, as does the growth of AI across major sectors like the automotive industry. The only caveat to investing in Nvidia is that it has a tremendous amount of growth and successful execution built into its price already.

Meta Platforms (META)
YTD gain as of Oct. 11: 172%
Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has jumped into the deep end when it comes to artificial intelligence. While not a producer of the physical components of AI systems like Nvidia, Meta relies on artificial intelligence to hone and improve its primary business, which is ad generation and monetization.
Over the past year or so, Meta has steadily boosted its digital advertising business, and it is capitalizing on AI and automation to keep it at the head of the pack. Meta’s huge gain in 2023 would normally keep value-based investors away, but after the big 64% loss the stock took in 2022, it hasn’t even returned to its highs of 2021.
Tesla (TSLA)
YTD gain as of Oct. 11: 113%
It might seem funny to think of a car company as an AI leader, but Tesla is a car company like no other. In addition to the technology that it took to even get an electric vehicle company off the ground, Tesla is lauded for its self-driving technology, which seems destined to be a mainstay of the future.
While still working out all the kinks, the AI behind Tesla’s automotive software is the best in the business and a sign of what’s to come. The stock is a huge long-term winner but is notoriously volatile, making it not for the faint of heart. In 2020 alone, Tesla stock rocketed up over 1,000%, while on the downside, it lost a whopping 65% in 2022. For those who can tolerate the swings, analysts still have a consensus buy rating on the stock.
Adobe (ADBE)
YTD gain as of Oct. 11: 63%
Adobe has been a perpetual winner in the stock market, but recent gains have been driven not as much by subscription revenue as by expansion into the AI market. The company boasts how its engineers and scientists are already hard at work on the next generation of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning to keep the company growing and provide solutions for individuals and businesses.
Analysts have a “strong buy” rating on the stock and a $600.77 price target over the next 12 months. That’s a potential gain of over 9%.
Lam Research (LRCX)
YTD gain as of Oct. 11: 53%
Lam Research may not be as well known as the other names on this list, but it’s a big player in the world of artificial intelligence. Lam Research doesn’t make semiconductors, but it makes the equipment that other players use to build them. Thus, when the AI chip industry is booming, so too is Lam Research.
The company is poised to benefit from the industry’s “4.0 transformation,” which will be led by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Companies such as Deloitte believe that semiconductor growth will remain strong at least through 2030, with Lam Research being a direct beneficiary.
Analysts have a consensus “strong buy” on the stock, with an average price target 12 months out of $706.46, about 10% above current levels.

She has solidified her status as a trailblazer and oracle in her near-decade-leading ARK. Wood and her firm have become synonymous with forward-thinking investing, focusing on disruptive, game-changing technologies. And she is not afraid to take positions in ""risky"" companies. She bought stock in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2016.
Wood has big ideas and makes splashy predictions – like her belief Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will top $1M by 2030. Cutting her teeth at firms like Capital Group and AllianceBernstein, Wood founded ARK in 2014, obsessed with transforming the way we think about investing, eschewing broad market, index-linked ETFs, in favor of focused, thematic funds that allow investors to express their view of the world to come.
The Funds
ARK ""strives to invest at the pace of innovation"". The firm offers 8 US-listed ETFs. They are:
ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) is Wood's flagship fund. It is all about disruptive innovation across various sectors, from technology to healthcare and beyond. It focuses on companies that are at the forefront of innovative and transformative technologies.
ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG) invests in companies involved in gene editing, gene therapy, and genomic sequencing.
ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) is all about the Internet and innovative web-related technologies. It invests in companies related to cloud computing, e-commerce, streaming, and social platforms. It seeks to capture the growth of the next-generation internet.
ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) focuses on autonomous technology and robotics. It invests in companies at the forefront of automation, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, and other advances in the robotics space.
ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) invests in companies disrupting traditional financial services through innovations like digital wallets, blockchain technology, and peer-to-peer lending.
ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX) focuses on space exploration and innovation. It aims to capture the growth potential in the aerospace and space industries. It invests in satellite technology, space tourism, and other advancements in the space sector.
3D Printing ETF (BATS:PRNT), unlike the above, is linked to an index. However, that index is ARK's own. The fund invests in 3D printing hardware, computer-aided design (""CAD"") and 3D printing simulation software, 3D printing centers, scanning and measurement, and 3D printing materials.
ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF (BATS:IZRL), like PRNT, is tied to an index created by ARK. The fund invests in Israeli companies at the forefront of global innovation in manufacturing, technology, healthcare, and communications.
ARK's funds have consistently performed well, largely outpacing the market. However, they are more prone to downswings and higher pain. That’s the cost for the significant upside each fund offers. Take ARKK, for example, the fund is up over 30% on the year, while the S&P is up 14%.
For those who want to further maximize their view, leveraged funds can help. The AXS 2X Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:TARK), for example, aims to return twice the daily return of ARKK.
Looking to Maximize Potential Upside in ARKK? Traders and investors looking for leveraged long exposure to ARKK can play the AXS 2x Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:TARK).
TARK is an actively managed 2X leveraged ETF aiming to return 200% of the daily performance of ARKK.

NVDA,2023-10-16 16:00:00,He thinks one asset is getting too much “hype.”,"Billionaire investor Charlie Munger trashed two popular investing trends in a keynote address at Zoom’s Zoomtopia 2023 conference.
The vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man — tossed a wet blanket on the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI).

‘A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency — 3 ways you can prepare
“I think it’s getting a huge amount of hype,” Munger said during his keynote address Oct. 4, according to Fortune. “I think it’s probably getting more than it deserves.”
He didn’t stop there. The no-nonsense 99-year-old also slammed Bitcoin — and to a wider extent, cryptocurrency — as “the stupidest investment I ever saw.”
With decades of investing experience under his belt, Munger is wary of hot commodities and stocks that could boom one year and tank the next. Here’s what he likes instead.
AI stocks
First, let’s unpack Munger’s negative comments on AI and crypto.
If you look at the so-called “Magnificent Seven” — the seven largest U.S. companies by market capitalization: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia , Tesla and Meta — they’ve all initiated immense AI projects and there’s been a huge injection of private equity into AI-focused businesses.
Many inventors see AI as the next big thing — but Munger is not on the bandwagon, noting at the conference that it has existed since the 1950s.
“We’ve always had artificial intelligence, where software creates more software,” he said. “And, of course, that’s very useful, [but] we’ve had it for a long time.”
This bold take from Munger was hardly shocking. The investor announced he was “personally skeptical” about AI at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting — adding: “I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.”
At the same meeting, Buffett likened the advent of AI to the creation of the atomic bomb.
“I know we won't be able to uninvent it,"" Buffett said. “But is it good for the next 200 years of the world?”
Both Munger and Buffett are known for making high-quality and long-term investments rather than jumping on the next hot asset or stock. Some of their long-term holdings are in companies that are actually driving the AI train, such as technology giants Apple and Amazon and some of the nation’s leading banks.

Bitcoin and crypto
Munger has been very vocal about his dislike for cryptocurrencies in the past — and it seems the crypto crash of 2022 and the implosion of crypto exchange FTX have only etched his opinion deeper in stone.
“Don’t get me started on Bitcoins,” he told the Zoomtopia audience, as reported by Fortune. “Most of those investments are going to zero.”
Bitcoin prices dropped nearly 65% in 2022, with the popular cryptocurrency logging its worst annual performance since 2018. The overall crypto market fared no better. After hitting a peak of around $3 trillion in November 2021, the crypto market took a dramatic nosedive in 2022, hitting a two-year market value low of $796 billion when FTX imploded.
This year, the market has clawed back some ground and crypto prices have proven resilient. Bitcoin prices are up around 70% year-to-date.
The Zoomtopia keynote wasn’t the first time Munger trashed digital currencies. In February, he penned an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal wherein he described crypto as “a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house” and called for an outright ban on cryptocurrency.
At the Daily Journal’s 2023 annual shareholder meeting, shortly after the op-ed was published, Munger said of crypto: “It’s massively stupid. It’s very dangerous. The governments were totally wrong to permit it. I’m not proud of my country for allowing this crap. It's worthless, it's no good, it's crazy, it'll do nothing but harm.”
Munger's favorite stocks
So what does one of America’s most successful investors like, if he’s not persuaded by AI and crypto?
Munger is a well-known value investor who works on the assumption that good opportunities are few and far between — and he’s willing to pay more for quality. Like Buffett, he plays the long game and uses the buy-and-hold investment strategy to reap the benefits of compound interest.
Munger’s latest 13F filing includes just four stock holdings: Wells Fargo at around 41%, Bank of America at around 40%, Alibaba at around 16% and U.S. Bancorp at around 3%.
Essentially, he has put all his eggs in two baskets: banking and e-commerce. Bank stocks in particular are a popular choice for value investors because most banks pay dividends, giving investors a share in profits.
Munger has a net worth of approximately $2.6 billion, according to Forbes.

“This is a hard problem to solve by just coming up with a list of components that are deemed critical and then applying some kind of guidance against it,” he said Tuesday at the WSJ Tech Live conference in Laguna Beach, California.
Arm licenses processor designs to the world’s biggest chipmakers, and its technology is ubiquitous across mobile devices today. It’s at the heart of Apple Inc.’s in-house chips and increasingly expanding into more power-intensive tasks like data center, artificial intelligence and automotive applications.
Arm’s chief executive officer made the remarks following new rules issued Tuesday by the Biden administration, which seeks to make it tougher for China to bring in cutting-edge semiconductors and equipment. The US government put out a roughly 450-page notice on the restrictions, which Arm is now evaluating, Haas said.
In large part, the effort aims to control the distribution of powerful GPUs, or graphics processor units. Nvidia Corp. is the leading seller of GPUs used to power artificial intelligence systems, and it’s now figuring out how to adjust to the stricter controls.

But GPUs are part of a wide range of components that go into computing systems, including the central processing unit, Haas said.
“The GPUs require CPUs; the GPUs require memory; the GPUs require power amplifiers,” he said. “The list of materials that go on to a circuit board is pretty vast.”
There may be different guidance in terms of where the thresholds should be, he said. “It’s a very hard problem to get right in terms of if you’re trying to curb access completely.”

Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia warned that the new rules could hinder product development and cause other difficulties, though the changes aren’t likely to take a financial toll in the short term.
The latest regulations, announced Tuesday, also limit exports to two Chinese artificial intelligence chip firms that are seen as rivals to US-based Nvidia. The rules — aimed at preventing China from accessing cutting-edge technology with military uses — cast a cloud over Nvidia shares and other US chip stocks.
“It’s a very hard problem to get right if you’re trying to curb access completely,” Arm Holdings Plc chief Rene Haas said in response to the new measures. Nvidia uses some of Arm’s technology in its Grace Hopper superchip.

Nvidia fell 4.7% to $439.38 in New York, marking its biggest single-day drop since Aug. 9. The stock had more than tripled this year before the pullback, fueled by the AI boom. The company makes the most popular AI accelerators, processors that help sophisticated algorithms handle massive amounts of data.
The tighter controls will target Nvidia’s A800 and H800 chips, a senior US official said, which the American firm created for export to China — the world’s largest market for chips — after the Biden administration introduced its initial restrictions last October.
“We comply with all applicable regulations while working to provide products that support thousands of applications across many different industries,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement. “Given the demand worldwide for our products, we don’t expect a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.”
In a regulatory filing later in the day, Nvidia said that the restrictions “may impact the company’s ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers of covered products, or supply customers of covered products outside the impacted regions.”
Morgan Stanley cut its price target for Nvidia shares because of what it called “draconian” export controls. Asian stocks related to AI chips fell after the official US announcement. Beijing-based Unisplendour Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., which sell data center gear in China, fell by roughly 10% before narrowing losses on Wednesday.
As part of the new rules, the Biden administration added two Chinese AI chip startups — Shanghai Biren Intelligent Technology Co. and Moore Threads Intelligent Technology Beijing Co. — and their subsidiaries to a trade restriction list. It mandates that companies obtain a US government license before shipping to those firms.
Biren said that it’s strongly opposed to the ruling and has urged the Commerce Department to review its decision. Moore Threads also protested its inclusion on the list and said it’s reviewing the impact on its business. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Monday at a regular press briefing in Beijing that her nation opposed “the US politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues.”
Read More: US to Tighten Rules Aimed at Keeping Advanced Chips Out of China
Bloomberg Intelligence says...
A recent surge in orders from large Chinese customers indicates stockpiling of 800-series chips in anticipation of such restrictions, pulling sales forward. Though the restrictions won’t greatly affect short-term estimates, they can erode Nvidia’s long-term prospects.
— Kunjan Sobhani, BI analyst
The new rules also require companies to notify the US government before selling chips that fall below the controlled threshold, as Bloomberg reported earlier. Top-of-the-line chips are best for powering AI models, a senior administration official said. But with a lot of money and a little jury-rigging, a whole class of slightly inferior chips could also be used for AI and supercomputing and therefore pose a national security risk, the official said.
The US wants to monitor that so-called gray zone activity, the official added, declining to comment on the specific parameters of which chips will be affected. The administration will review company notifications within 25 days, the official said, to determine whether firms need a license to sell those chips to China.
“It’s difficult to draw a bright line between military and commercial technology,” US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters ahead of publication of the rules. “There are often dual-use technologies — and the same technologies that fuel commercial exchange, unfortunately, sometimes can also allow our competitors to modernize their military, surveil their citizens and solidify oppression.”
But the US doesn’t want to be more restrictive than necessary, Raimondo said, emphasizing a message from the Biden administration that Washington doesn’t seek to hurt China’s economy.
Washington relented in one key area following a year of public comment on the initial rule: The updated curbs broadly allow the sale of advanced commercial chips to Chinese companies for use in consumer products like smartphones, computers and electric vehicles, as Bloomberg reported earlier. But the Biden administration will restrict the most advanced consumer chips — like those used in AI data centers — and impose a notification process on a select number of varieties just shy of the cutting edge.
The administration will also require firms to obtain a license to sell chips to more than 40 countries that Chinese firms could use as intermediaries to skirt US controls.
The US is expanding the scope of manufacturing gear subject to restrictions, said senior administration officials, without specifying the exact equipment. Asked whether the US would restrict less advanced DUV machines, which are mainly supplied by Dutch chip equipment leader ASML Holding NV, an administration official said that Washington has worked with the Netherlands on the policy.
Read More: ASML Says New US Curbs May Hit China Sales in Medium Term
ASML’s chief executive officer publicly opposed the initial US restrictions, and it took months before the US was able to get its key allies in Amsterdam and Tokyo on board.
The new regulations will be applicable to a “limited number” of ASML fabs in China related to advanced semiconductor manufacturing, the firm said in a statement, without specifying which machines will be impacted.
“These export control measures will likely have an impact on the regional split of our systems sales in the medium to long term,” ASML said. “However, we do not expect these measures to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023 and for our longer-term scenarios.”
The updated rules won’t include restrictions on access to US or allied cloud computing services, though the administration will issue a request for comment to better understand potential national security risks associated with this access — and options to potentially address them.
“Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere,” said industry group Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents Nvidia and major US equipment suppliers including Applied Materials Inc.
Applied Materials said in a statement that it’s “assessing the impact of the regulations” and expects to apply for licenses where they’re now required.
In its filing, Nvidia noted that the rules impose additional licensing requirements not just on exports to China, but countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. It said it had no assurance that the US government will grant exceptions or licenses or “will act on the request in a timely manner.”
Nvidia also may have to “transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries,” according to the filing.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - While stripping China's access to key U.S. artificial intelligence chips, the Biden administration's sweeping new rules also quietly threw Nvidia, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) a potential lifeline to preserve lucrative business in one of the world's biggest chip markets.

Thomas Krueger, a former U.S. National Security Council export control official, said ""the organizing principle for all these rules is to keep them focused on those capabilities that can enable Chinese military systems. They're not interested in going after broad consumer applications. They're really trying to thread that needle.""
U.S. officials asked for input in devising a ""tamperproof"" way to keep systems that might contain up to 256 AI chips from being strung together into a supercomputer.
""This approach could constrain (controlled AI chips) from being used to train large dual-use AI foundation models with capabilities of concern, while allowing AI training capabilities at a small or medium scale,"" the BIS wrote.
Nvidia, Intel and AMD declined to comment. Nvidia shares closed down 4.67% on Tuesday after the new rules were announced.
The other primary gift that U.S. officials gave Nvidia, Intel and AMD was hobbling their most capable Chinese competitors.
New rules will make it nearly impossible for Moore Threads and Biren, two well-funded Chinese startups founded by Nvidia veterans, to have their designs manufactured using cutting-edge chipmaking technology.
That means whatever Nvidia is able to sell to China will likely be Chinese buyers' best legal option.
""Our assumption is that (Nvidia) will quickly redesign a chip to meet new standards with relatively immaterial disruptions to the current business outlook,"" analysts at investment bank Piper Sandler wrote in a note to clients.
TOOL RULES TIGHTENED
As part of the new rules published on Tuesday that take effect in 30 days, U.S. officials targeted China's chip manufacturers by restricting the export of advanced chipmaking equipment known as immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines if they contain any American parts.
""What they're really doing is closing all the doors,"" TechInsights analyst Dan Hutcheson said, adding the new rules close off a substantial amount of potential future developments. ""They're basically trying to future-proof the document.""
The DUV machines are not produced by any American toolmakers, but are made by Japan's Nikon and the Netherlands' ASML.
The DUV rules announced on Tuesday codified diplomatic work between the U.S., Japan and the Netherlands to institute similar controls on sending the machines to China, said Clete Willems, a trade and policy attorney with Akin Gump.
While immersion DUV machines cannot product cutting-edge chips, they can come close and are likely what was recently used by Huawei's chip manufacturing partners to create a new smartphone chip for its Mate 60 Pro, according to analysts.
""This control alone will constrain China’s ability to expand advanced node semiconductor manufacturing for many years,"" said Gregory Allen, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""If spare parts and components for the equipment can be effectively controlled, the new regulations may degrade the advanced node manufacturing facilities that China currently has in operation.""
Instead of the broad swaths of tools blocked by last year's export restrictions, officials on Tuesday narrowed them to target specific technologies and techniques found in the complex machines needed to build advanced transistor designs, according to David Kanter, President of Real World Insights.
By narrowing the equipment that is blocked, the rules allow the toolmakers to sell equipment that is made to build much older chips without fear of running afoul of the government restrictions.

NVDA,2023-10-18 08:10:01,"Recruiters say applicants don't always need college degrees, but should be able to demonstrate AI interest.","Companies are hiring for AI talent as they seek to cash in on the generative AI hype.
Insider spoke to four hiring leaders to get their advice on how to land a job in AI.
Applicants don't need a technical degree and should be careful when using AI to apply for jobs.
Artificial intelligence may have the potential to wipe out your job — but you might be safe if you're working behind the technology.
Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT last November, generative AI technology has taken the corporate world by storm. Venture capital firms have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into AI startups, and companies across industries are looking to beef up their own AI strategies in an effort to cash in on the hype.
That means more jobs in the generative AI space, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Netflix hiring employees to work on their AI initiatives and listing six-figure salaries.
But it's not just tech companies seeking AI talent. Employers across a range of sectors — from law to education to healthcare — have been looking to hire workers familiar with tools like ChatGPT, and some were hiring prompt engineers to fine-tune their own AI chatbots.
So how do you start a career in AI and land a job?
To understand what recruiters look for in applicants, Insider spoke to four hiring leaders at IBM, Nvidia, Hugging Face, and Jasper for their advice on how to land an AI-related job at their respective companies.
Here are 4 tips from hiring leaders on how to increase your chances of landing a job in AI.
1) Include your AI skills and past projects on your résumé
Before submitting your job application, make sure your résumé includes the skills and projects needed for the role.
When reviewing applications, Nvidia, the chip giant hiring for technical roles related to machine learning and AI, looks for ""critical skills"" related to math proficiency, programming, deep learning, algorithms, data handling, and AI infrastructure like utilizing graphic processing units, Lindsey Duran, the vice president of global recruiting at Nvidia, told Insider.
IBM, the tech giant currently hiring AI engineers, AI application consultants, and AI research scientists, also requires applicants to have strong math and coding skills, as well as an understanding of APIs and other technical concepts, Chris Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, told Insider.
Demonstrating your technical expertise by showing examples of previous work is a plus, Flavien Coronini, the talent acquisition lead at Hugging Face, an AI company behind tools like text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, told Insider.
Since Hugging Face is an open source company, Coronini said he looks for GitHub links to their projects when reviewing resumes. By reviewing their projects, Coronini said he can gauge how much impact the applicant could bring to Hugging Face — whether that's the ability to solve a problem or make a program run faster — and can identify if their vision aligns with the company's mission.
When making hiring decisions for less-technical roles like sales and product management, the three recruiters said they look for ""soft skills"" like strong communication, the ability to collaborate, and adaptability to change.
2) Demonstrate your interest in AI during the interview — and be able to prove it
If you're lucky enough to land an interview, be prepared to talk about your interest in generative AI.
Alex Shapiro, the chief people officer at Jasper AI, an AI marketing and writing software that Shapiro said recently completed its ""key hiring"" over the last three years, said she expects job candidates to show that they've ""done their homework"" and ""understand the technology."" For instance, she said that candidates for engineering roles should be able to differentiate between a ""model layer"" and an ""app layer.""
For technical and non-technical roles alike, interviewees can stand out if they can articulate how they've been playing around with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This especially applies to those interviewing for client-facing roles like customer service as it shows ""whether or not people have dived into this industry,"" she said.
""For a new field, I think what helps us to differentiate people is just how much curiosity they've had about the space and what work they've done to learn more about it,"" Shapiro told Insider.
Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, would agree with Shapiro. He said that applicants who read AI research papers, follow AI forums, and explore AI-related online courses stand out from the pool because it shows they are genuinely curious about AI and have a ""desire to continuously learn.""
3) Don't expect your ChatGPT skills to get you hired
Using AI tools like ChatGPT can be useful when writing your résumé and cover letters. But make sure you double-check the AI-generated documents for accuracy before submitting them.
Shapiro acknowledged that using ChatGPT can be ""great"" in helping applicants ""brainstorm verbs"" and ""bring a level of polish"" to their applications. However, she urges applicants to make sure their AI-generated documents accurately reflect their qualities.
She said there's been times when Jasper recruiters interviewed candidates and discovered that there's a skill in their resume they didn't intend to be there, or a characterization they're not familiar with, which she said could lead to problems down the line.
In fact, ChatGPT can actually hurt an applicant's chances of moving forward in the hiring process if the chatbot is used irresponsibly.
Duran from Nvidia said there's been instances where recruiters at her company caught candidates using ChatGPT during interviews to answer questions, which she said is prohibited. Coronini from Hugging Face has even seen cover letters that include prompts like ""Insert a cover letter in order to explain why my background is a good fit for this role"" used to generate them — which he calls a"" ""really bad"" practice.
""For me, this is a showstopper, because it doesn't really show your motivation to join,"" he said.
4) Don't be afraid to apply — even if you don't meet all of the job requirements
Many AI job listings may require applicants to have college or higher level degrees in computer science and engineering. But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.
Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.
Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.
In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.
""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.","Want a job in AI? 4 tips from hiring leaders at IBM, Nvidia, and AI startups on how to land one.",439.38,421.95999,421.01001,10,2023,18

The primary chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) expects to spend $32 billion on growing and upgrading capacity in 2023, the lower end of a previously projected range. Still, that figure surpassed the $30.5 billion in capital spending analysts had expected. Executives on Thursday told investors they were seeing signs that demand was stabilizing and close to bottoming after more than a year of post-Covid malaise.
TSMC is counting on a sustained boom in chipmaking to train AI services sparked by the advent of ChatGPT. Companies from the US to China are rushing to build artificial intelligence tools, which require the sort of high-end chips that the Taiwanese company dominates. It posted better-than-expected net income in the third quarter of NT$211 billion ($6.5 billion).
“We see early signs of demand stabilization in the PC and smartphone markets. Those two are the biggest segments for TSMC’s business,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told analysts on a conference call. “We want to say that 2024 will have very healthy growth,” Wei added, though he emphasized it was too early to call a strong rebound.
For now, demand for semiconductors overall remains uncertain following a Covid-era boom in internet activity that fueled a surge in datacenter construction. China, the world’s biggest market for smartphones and chips, is struggling to revive growth even as the US government tightens restrictions on the Asian nation’s tech sector.
Washington’s constraints could reduce manufacturing orders to TSMC from US chip designers such as Nvidia for certain AI chips in the medium to long term, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum.
A day before TSMC’s report, Dutch chip gear supplier ASML Holding NV reported a big drop in order bookings for the September quarter. TSMC is one of ASML’s biggest customers and its slower spending was reflected in ASML’s results, portending a potential cut in capital expenditure by the Taiwanese firm.
The company also makes iPhone chips, and demand for consumer gadgets has been affected by the downturn. Still, fellow supply chain bellwether Murata Manufacturing Co. said this week the smartphone market has bottomed out and will resume growth this year.
Longer term, TSMC is spending heavily on chip plants around the world. Executives said its $40 billion Arizona site was on track to start production in 2025’s first half, while a Japanese plant is slated to begin mass output in late 2024.

What looked like a prescient bet in mid-September — the stock surged 14% over 15 trading days — turned sour this week as shares tumbled nearly 9% in the worst five-day stretch in more than a year. The rout was triggered by new US rules aimed at restricting cutting-edge technology from China, a move that threatens a chunk of the one-fifth of Nvidia’s revenue that came from that country last quarter.
It was another harsh reminder for Nvidia fans that for all the hype around its position as a primary beneficiary of the artificial-intelligence gold rush, the company’s more immediate prospects are at the mercy of the geopolitical struggle over the chips that power virtually every aspect of the modern world. It’s also not immune to rising interest rates and the economic concerns weighing on markets.
“It’s certainly at a vulnerable point,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “But you could’ve said that the last two times that it went down here after that big upside move.”
Nvidia vaulted to the top of performance charts in May after it gave a sales forecast that shattered analyst expectations and solidified the chipmaker as a main beneficiary of the AI trend. The stock’s record surge put Nvidia’s market capitalization in reach of $1 trillion, a level it surpassed in June. At its next earnings release in August, another blowout report catapulted shares to an all-time high.
Since reaching that peak, performance has been rockier. Shares fell 12% in September, its worst monthly performance in 2023, weighed down by concerns about demand sustainability.
Even though the stock is still up more than 180% this year and is the top performer on both the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq 100, nearly $200 billion in market value has been erased from the end of August through Friday’s close. Nvidia is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 21.
Nvidia’s Top Gamer Graphics Card Caught Up in US-China Trade War
So far, Wall Street analysts haven’t changed their bullish tune on the stock. While some have cut price targets, 95% of analysts have a buy-equivalent rating on Nvidia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Citi lowered its price target to $575 from $630 while keeping its buy rating. Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore — who recommended buying the stock in its September dip — maintained their overweight rating but cut their price target to $600 from $630.
“This is a significant setback, but business is likely to continue to exceed expectations despite that,” Moore wrote in a note dated Wednesday, adding that Nvidia is still their top pick in the semiconductor sector.
For Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, the added export restrictions for China shipments hardly dents Nvidia’s long-term appeal.
“You’re going to see some volatility in the stock that’s not pleasant to go through, but it’s also not unexpected,” he said. “We like Nvidia in our portfolio, and we see value when it pulls back.”
Tech Chart of the Day
Tesla Inc. shares have fallen 16% this week, its biggest weekly drop this year. Tesla’s price cuts this year show that customers are no longer willing to pay a premium for its vehicles. Shares of the company fell 9.3% on Thursday after it reported its quarterly earnings update and extended declines Friday.

""If we didn’t already have a plant in China, we sure wouldn’t start one now,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Jason Andringa’s company was part of the stampede of U.S. businesses that built factories in China.
Iowa-based Vermeer, a 4,000-employee maker of industrial and farm machinery, opened a plant there two decades ago—and Andringa, the company’s president and CEO, frequently visited what many be considered the world’s premier fast-growing, future-oriented economy. But the mood of Vermeer and many other global producers has turned sour on China.
""If we didn’t already have a plant in China, we sure wouldn’t start one now,"" he said.
He has no plan to leave and is pleased with the operation, but said he would not expand there given the tensions in the U.S.-China relationship that seem more likely than not to escalate. He worries it could be increasingly difficult to find employees and receive fair treatment in a country that is mutually antagonistic with the U.S.
The latest example of that hit Tuesday, when the Biden administration said it plans to halt shipments to China of more advanced artificial intelligence chips designed by Nvidia and others. The move is aimed at curbing Beijing's access to cutting-edge technology that could be used in weapons.
Surveys now show U.S. business leaders are eager to cut back their China exposure and are shifting investment to other, friendlier countries. This is a radical shift from the days when offshoring production to China was rewarded by Wall Street and investor calls often highlighted multi-million-dollar expansions in the world’s second-largest economy.
Mexico has surpassed China as the top destination for foreign direct investment by U.S. firms, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, while a survey from the U.S.-China Business Council shows a growing number of U.S. firms pulling back on their China investments.
ACCELERATING EXODUS
Souring trade relations would likely be a key topic if U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet next month during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. The White House is working to arrange a meeting, though the plans remain unsettled.
The move away from China began on a small scale during the Trump administration’s trade war, as producers shifted supply chains to sidestep the cost of tariffs.
The exodus has intensified as relations between Beijing and Washington have continued to deteriorate under the Biden administration, morphing from a trade battle into a geopolitical struggle over Taiwan and the U.S. downing of China's spy balloon.
After a visit to China in August, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said U.S. companies had complained to her that China has become ""uninvestible,"" due to government actions such as fines and raids that have made it risky to do business in the country.
""We have businesses doing full exits from China,"" said Matt Dollard, a senior analyst at RSM US, a consulting firm that focuses on mid-market companies.
For instance, Dollard is working with a group of auto suppliers who plan to be entirely out of China within three years, he said. But many find it isn’t easy to leave a country that developed such a vast production base. In many cases, they end up expanding operations in other countries that still require parts and raw materials from China to produce finished goods.
CAUGHT IN CHINA'S WEB
The mood swing against China is visible in the numbers. An annual survey by the U.S.-China Business Council, conducted in June and July, showed more than a third of respondents have cut or paused their investments in China over the past year—a record high and far above the 22% who said that in last year’s survey. Most of the respondents to the survey are large U.S.-based multinationals.
The group said geopolitics is the ""single largest issue weighing down business sentiment over the long term."" However only a few of the firms indicated they plan to fully exit China.
Faced with these pressures, many companies are pursuing a so-called China-plus-one strategy. Rather than expand in China, these companies are directing new investments to other low-cost countries such as Vietnam and India.
To be sure, some companies are doubling down on China. Ryan Gunnigle, CEO of Atlanta-based toy maker Kids2, said he is continuing to invest in his China factories, adding both automation and new capacity. Gunnigle, in an email, said he is doing a few projects in Vietnam, ""but nothing of significance"" because China continues to have the combination of a strong infrastructure, high quality producers, and low costs necessary in the toy business.
""POLITICAL"" CONCERNS
Meanwhile, companies that are pushing to build new factories or find existing suppliers in other countries face a common problem: they often end up still relying heavily on Chinese factories for parts and materials.
Jim Estill is wrangling with this issue. The CEO of Danby Appliances, a Canadian company that sells over half of its products in the U.S., got 85% of its goods from Chinese factories five years ago. He’s been steadily moving to suppliers in places like Turkey and hopes to have his Chinese supply base down to 50% in the next year.
Danby also has its own factories in the U.S. and Canada that do final assembly of some products and has spent over $20 million over the past few years to buy operations in Canada that can supply parts to those factories. Those parts would have previously come from China, said Estill.
""My concerns are primarily political,"" he said. ""We could wake up tomorrow and find out China invades Taiwan."" That would shatter his business.

Oct 23 (Reuters) - Futures tracking Wall Street's main stock indexes slumped on Monday as yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note hit a crucially watched 5% mark, sparking a selloff in megacap stocks.
The
yield
on the note touched the July 2007 milestone that it briefly attempted to scale last week. It was last at 5.0144%.
""When investors can earn a 5% annual return on safe assets such as government bonds, they are less likely to take chances on riskier plays,"" Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at forex broker XM, said in a note.
""Beyond providing an attractive alternative to equities, higher bond yields also make it more costly for businesses to take on debt, limiting the scope for expansion and ultimately earnings growth.""
Megacaps including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com slid between 0.6% and 1.5% in premarket trading.
Focus will also remain on a busy week of earnings, with four of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks reporting later this week whose gains have powered the S&P 500 higher in 2023 while the rest of the indexes lagged.
Chipmaker Intel, oil major Exxon Mobil, General Motors are some of the other companies reporting quarterly results this week.
Of the 86 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far in the third quarter, 78% have been above analyst estimates, according to the LSEG data. Overall, third-quarter earnings are likely to grow 1% year-on-year.
Meanwhile, Israel
bombarded Gaza
with air strikes overnight, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convening a meeting of his top generals and his war cabinet to assess the escalating conflict.
These rising tensions, along with surging bond yields on higher rates expectations, pulled Wall Street lower last week, with the S&P 500 falling 1.26% and the Cboe Volatility index closing at its highest since March 24.
The benchmark stock index is down 8% from late July, when it hit its highest for the year, though still up 10% year-to-date.
U.S. GDP print will be closely monitored by investors in the week amid expectations that the economy grew at a robust 4.2% in the third quarter, which might warrant tighter monetary policy.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be giving brief introductory remarks at an event on Wednesday but it is unlikely he would speak on monetary policy since the blackout period for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicked in on Saturday.
The week will end with the release of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - for September.
At 6:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 224 points, or 0.67%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 31.5 points, or 0.74%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 129.75 points, or 0.88%.

The Santa Clara- and Seoul-based startup said it has raised a $22 million Series B round, bringing its total raised to $30 million.
Moreh says its flagship AI software, called the MoAI, is similar to Nvidia’s CUDA but is compatible with existing machine learning frameworks like Meta’s PyTorch, Google’s TensorFlow, and applications and AI models that previously could only run on Nvidia.
The startup believes existing AI software is suitable for small-scale AI models using only a few GPUs (graphics processing units) but is inadequate for more massive AI infrastructure. According to a recent report, as “AI is rapidly maturing at enterprise scale,” companies’ IT infrastructure and data architectures are ""unfit"" for training AI models.
Moreh’s AI solutions allow users, including AI developers, data center operators and AI chip makers, to build more flexible AI infrastructure, important given the general shortage of GPUs globally, Gangwon Jo, co-founder and CEO at Moreh, told TechCrunch.
The three-year-old startup’s AI software enables GPUs and other AI chips, such as neural processing units (NPUs), to operate AI models, including large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and T5, without any code changes, Jo explained. (NPU is a specialized chip designed to accelerate machine learning algorithms, while GPU is used for supercomputing, AI, machine learning, and extensive data analysis where numerical precision is required.)
KT has been working with Moreh since 2021 to build a cost-effective, scaleable AI infrastructure powered by AMD GPUs and MoAI software.
KT claims that Moreh’s offering proved its technology works and that its performance in developing LLM and other AI models surpassed Nvidia’s DGX in terms of performance speed and GPU memory capacity. AMD's MI250 Instinct accelerator powered by the MoAI platform showed 116% higher GPU throughput than Nvidia's A100, according to Moreh, which also said AI developers could reduce a tenth of the total time required to initiate training for large AI models via its software.
Most recently, the startup completed the training of Korean-language-based LLM with 211 billion parameters and will release the model as open source later this year.
Moreh started generating revenue in 2021 and aims to reach approximately $30 million by the end of 2023, Jo told TechCrunch.
“The AI software ecosystem supporting AMD AI hardware continues to grow, providing choice for data scientists and other users of AI as they build the AI models and solutions that will drive the continued growth of this industry,” Brad McCredie, corporate vice president of data center GPU and accelerated processing at AMD, said in a statement.
Moreh will use the money for research and development, product expansion and hiring additional staff, which now has 70 employees.

CentML, which builds software to help machine learning systems work more efficiently, raised $27 million from investors including Google’s Gradient Ventures and Radical Ventures. Deloitte Ventures and Thomson Reuters Ventures also took part in the financing, the startup said in a statement.
The Toronto-headquartered startup aims to address one of the biggest bottlenecks in AI development, a shortage of the graphic processor units from Nvidia and its rivals that process the enormous amounts of data required to train and run AI systems. Supply could remain tight well into 2024 as prices skyrocket, analysts predict.
Big-name backers are betting on young firms like CentML to find innovative ways around those constraints.
CentML was established last year by Gennady Pekhimenko, a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University who’s now an associate professor at the University of Toronto’s computer science department. Pekhimenko and three others built software to help predict the time taken to process tasks using different kinds of hardware. It monitors systems to pinpoint areas of underutilization — analyzing cost, power consumption and emissions — then automatically distributes tasks to try and speed them up.
That should in turn help maximize chip use and shave costs. The average utilization for GPUs across the market stands at around 30%, CentML said, citing research it’s conducted. Its technology can quicken systems “by as much as 8X, which has profound impact for our customers,” said Pekhimenko, also the startup’s chief executive officer.
His startup now plans to open an office in Silicon Valley to attract talent. Pekhimenko aims to double the size of its workforce, now about 30, over the next 12 months.
“The size of AI models grew 10 times annually in the last decade, and the gap between compute and the size of the model is growing,” he said in an interview. “There’s a desperation for compute, and chipmakers can’t supply it fast enough.”
Investment into AI is surging globally. According to PitchBook data compiled for Bloomberg, the value of funding for AI companies climbed 27% globally in the third quarter compared to the year before. That’s even as overall deals for startups fell 31% from a year earlier to hit $73 billion worldwide.

Video Transcript
JARED BLIKRE: Let's talk about the S&P 500 first. And we'll get into some of the small caps and tech stocks. But first, here's a year to date, look at what's happening. 4,200 in the index. If you're looking at SPY, it's 420. We can see we broke that very recently. What are you seeing in the technicals here? Anything to be concerned about?
MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, what's so interesting coming into today was that the McClellan Oscillator or the market breadth actually stopped declining while the price continued to which, generally means that the selling may be at this point in time drying up. So that 420 or 4,200 level is important. But you can see, if you go back to May and June, we're coming into some support levels, which probably means a bounce. The question is, how far? That 417 to 420 level will be the key resistance.
It's also interestingly, a 23-month moving average, which means that whole expansion we saw over that two-year business cycle, the first half of this year has now been violated. And so most likely, it points to a stagnation, rather than maybe the end of the whole market.
JARED BLIKRE: All right. So maybe, a bounce is in the cards. But I'm telling you, if I look at the Russell 2000, this has simply fallen out of bed, as you heard Diane say, lowest level since basically the Biden election. What are you seeing in the small cap space right now?
MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, yeah. I mean, this is completely contrast to what we just mentioned in the spy. That doesn't mean it couldn't have a bounce. But looking back, again, zooming out at that monthly situation, I love those monthly charts, this broke down under the 23-month long before the spy did, number one. Number two is, it broke the 80-month. That's a six to seven-year business cycle. Typically, that would be a recessionary indicator, because it means a real turn down in terms of the business cycle.
So yet it's a monthly, so that means we have some chance, maybe of getting back over 170, if we're looking at IWM, but right now, that seems like a Herculean task. And if this can't make it, then I would not necessarily stay very positive in anything.
JARED BLIKRE: All right. It looks like transportation kind of in a similar vein here. I want to skip ahead though to NVIDIA actually. We were just talking about this over the break. And we have this island here, if you want to call it, that it's basically a three or four-month consolidation. But we're at the lower end of this, and if you look real closely and squint, you can see kind of a head and shoulders top as well.
MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, yeah, NVIDIA of course, would be obviously something that everybody's going to have eyes on to represent the chip industry. And of course, we have some fundamental reasons to be a little bit concerned with China. But just from a technical standpoint, there's also that big gap that you saw on the original chart.
JARED BLIKRE: Here we go. Right there.
MICHELE SCHNEIDER: So this is another scary situation in that you're right, head and shoulders top could emerge. And if we start to fill into that gap territory, I do not look at that as a healthy sign. It seems to me that the whole semiconductor growth stock space got a little rich, especially when we just looked at transportation--
JARED BLIKRE: Too much hype?
MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Yeah, too much hype. So yeah, I wouldn't be surprised to see a bigger correction there.","S&P 500, Nvidia, Russell 2000: What the charts reveal",403.26001,405.0,411.60999,10,2023,27
NVDA,2023-10-27 16:57:34,Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says the company isn't nervous about competition from Nvidia and Qualcomm in the PC chip space.,"Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger isn’t afraid of a little competition from Nvidia (NVDA) or Qualcomm (QCOM), at least when it comes to one part of the chip market.
During Intel’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday, Gelsinger told analysts that the threat of either company taking away market share from Intel in the PC CPU (central processing unit) market isn’t something he’s worried about.
“Arm and Windows client alternatives … generally they've been relegated to pretty insignificant roles in the PC business,” Gelsinger said when asked about reports that Nvidia is working on building an Arm-based CPU to rival Intel’s own PC offerings. Qualcomm also recently announced its own Intel challenger.
“We take all competition seriously … but think history is our guide here. We don't see these as potentially being all that significant overall,” Gelsinger said. “Our momentum is strong. We have a strong roadmap for Meteor Lake launching … Dec. 14.”
Meteor Lake is Intel’s next-generation chip and marks a major departure from its past designs. The new chips are made up of individual pieces called chiplets that make up the CPU, GPU (graphics processing unit), and other components of a traditional chip to come together to form a whole product.
The idea is to make a more efficient and powerful chip that Intel’s corporate customers can easily customize. Meteor Lake also includes a NPU, or neural processing unit, to power AI operations.
On Monday, Reuters reported that Nvidia is in the midst of developing its own Arm-based CPUs meant for use in Windows-based PCs to rival Intel and AMD’s existing offerings. Nvidia already develops its Grace Arm-based CPU for data centers, so it’s not the company’s first time getting into the game.
Qualcomm, meanwhile, unveiled its latest CPU for Windows PCs, dubbed the Snapdragon X Elite, during an event held in Hawaii this week. According to the company, the X Elite will be able to power AI-based tasks and have enough performance to tangle with Intel’s PC chips and Apple’s custom chips. Qualcomm has produced its own PC chips in the past, though it ran into compatibility issues when trying to run some Windows apps.
The Nvidia report and Qualcomm news come as the global PC market is in the midst of a turnaround after two years of steep sales declines following a massive spike during the pandemic. Consumers purchased millions of PCs at the start of the pandemic to both work from home and stay occupied during lockdowns.
According to research firm Gartner, PC shipments have declined significantly over the past eight quarters. But there’s hope for the industry on the horizon.
“The good news for PC vendors is that the worst could be over by the end of 2023,” Gartner director and analyst Mikako Kitagawa said via a press release in early October. “The business PC market is ready for the next replacement cycle, driven by the Windows 11 upgrades. Consumer PC demand should also begin to recover as PCs purchased during the pandemic are entering the early stages of a refresh cycle.”
That should give Intel a nice boost going into the next year. But, depending on how Qualcomm’s chips turn out and if Nvidia’s are available by then, it could be a boon for its rivals, as well.
Either way, Intel is still far and away the PC market leader, holding 70% of the market as of January 2023, and Gelsinger doesn’t seem concerned about it losing that position anytime soon.

Oct 30 (Reuters) - 3D metal-printing startup Seurat Technologies on Monday hinted at potentially going public in the medium-term and said it had raised $99 million in a funding round co-led by chip designer Nvidia's venture capital arm.
With the latest series C funding round, the company's valuation will approach $350 million, said a source who asked not to be named.
""I expect that (going public) is in our cards ... 12-18 months is the earliest we would consider that ... potentially more like 24 or 36,"" Seurat CEO James DeMuth told Reuters in an interview, adding that proceeds from the financing round will be used to deploy its production printers.
The fundraise, co-led by Nvidia's NVentures and Capricorn's Technology Impact Fund, brought in new investors Honda Motor and Cubit Capital. Existing backers including Porsche and venture capital units of Xerox Holdings and General Motors Co also participated.
Seurat is looking to bring parts manufacturing, with its green energy-powered Area Printing technology, closer to customer factories around the world in a bid to reshore supply chains and slash emissions.
Over the past couple of years, companies across industries globally have been looking to diversify supply chains to reduce their dependence on China to address business continuity concerns and as U.S.-Sino trade tensions heat up.
""Seurat's local factory deployment model provides the industry with a solution to near-shore manufacturing and to increase the resiliency of supply chains,"" said existing investor Porsche Automobil Holding's board member Lutz Meschke.
Seurat also has commitments to supply 59 tons of metal components for Siemens Energy's turbines over a six-year period and the startup said earlier this month that it had received letters of intent from global manufacturers exceeding capacity of its pilot factory in Massachusetts.

The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the end of its policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
However, certain parts of the economy have proved to be resilient, spurring concerns that the central bank could signal willingness to hold rates at their current level for longer than previously anticipated.

(Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday published new research into using chatbots that can generate human-like responses in the process of designing semiconductors.
Modern chips are circuits built out of tens of billions of transistors, and figuring out how to arrange them on a piece of silicon is one of the hardest tasks in the technology industry, taking thousands of engineers up to two years to complete.
Nvidia's chips are among the most complex in the industry and have become central to power technologies like ChatGPT.
On Monday, Nvidia presented research where it took what is called a large language model, the technology behind chatbots, and augmented it with 30 years of data from its archives of designing chips. One of the first applications is to use the company's long history in answering questions.
""It turns out a lot of our senior designers spend a fair amount of their time answering questions from junior designers,"" Nvidia's chief scientist Bill Dally told Reuters. ""So the protocol was a junior designer asks the chatbot. This can save senior designers a huge amount of time.""
The key finding in the research was that a relatively modest chatbot could become more accurate than an advanced chatbot by specifically adding in lots of specific data from the company's experience, which Nvidia said can help control the cost of the system.
Another feature the company showed was using artificial intelligence to generate code. Dally said a big chunk of engineers' time is dedicated to finding a part of the chip that doesn't work and using testing tools to find out why.
To carry out that testing, AI systems can quickly write piece of code called a script that operates the tool.
""Our goal here is not to automate the process or replace people, but to take the people we have and just give them super powers to make them more productive,"" Dally said.

NVDA,2023-10-30 17:28:18,"Jensen Huang, CEO of chip giant Nvidia, also says he doesn't wear a watch so he can ""enjoy the moment.""","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang credited his style to his wife and daughter in a recent interview.
Huang's black leather jacket is notorious and spurred a cottage industry of copycats.
The interest in his signature style comes as the chip maker attempts to cash in on the AI hype.
Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, is rarely seen in public without his shiny black leather jacket — but he doesn't take credit for his signature style.
During an interview for HP's online show ""The Moment,"" host Ryan Patel asked the 60-year-old CEO about how he feels about being a fashion icon.
""You got the infamous jacket,"" Patel said. Now, at Denny's I'm sure you weren't thinking you were gonna be the style star of the future, but now you are. What do you think? How do you feel?"" he added, referring to the diner chain where the idea for Nvidia was born.
""Don't give me that,"" Huang replied, modestly. ""I'm happy that my wife and my daughter dresses me.""
The CEO of the chip giant is married to Lori Huang, who he met when he was 16 in an electrical engineering class.
""I had a great pickup,"" he said in the interview. ""I asked her if she wanted to see my homework.""
Huang's signature look is so popular that some online sellers have tried to capitalize off of it, selling knockoffs using his name or image on Amazon, Jacketpop, and Wilson Jackets.
Of course, Huang isn't just known for his motorcyclist aesthetic. The CEO, who has a net worth of $36.1 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has helped pave the way toward an AI future through Nvidia's GPUs, a specialized type of computer chip. The company has seen its stock price grow over 200% in the last year.
In August, Nvidia announced its plans to triple production of its $40,000 chips to meet the demand from AI companies. That same month, he predicted that $1 trillion will be spent over the next four years on upgrading AI data centers. He expects the chip bill to be paid largely by cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as Meta, which is leaning into generative AI with its large language model Llama 2.
Huang said that he never expect his company — which has seen its stock price grow over 200% in the last year — to come this far.
""People are surprised, but I don't have long-term plans,"" Huang said.
""My plan is to be here, do an incredibly good job, make a contributing, enjoy the moment — which is the reason why I don't wear a watch,"" he said, pointing to another element, or lack there of, of his signature style.

Investors' fears about higher interest rates and a bond-market crash have fueled the sell-off.
Big names like Ford, Bank of American, and Morgan Stanley are among the stocks that have plunged.
Stocks' first-half rally has ground to a dramatic halt over the past three months – the sell-off has now entered bear-market territory for some of the US's best-known listed companies.
Ford, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley are among the high-profile names that have dropped more than 20% since the S&P 500 hit its peak for the year on July 31.
The benchmark index has dropped 10% and 117 other stocks – including American Airlines, General Motors, 3M Company and Citigroup – have also shed at least one-fifth of their value over the same period.
Stocks started 2023 on an AI-powered tear, but have erased some of those gains in the second half with investors fretting that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high well into 2024 in a bid to kill off inflation, which is still lingering above the central bank's 2% target.
In recent weeks, a historic bond-market rout has also weighed on equities, with longer-duration US Treasury yields rising above 5% for the first time in 16 years. When debt yields are higher, stocks' relative appeal falls as investors pivot to lower-risk fixed-income assets.
Carmakers and banks aren't the only companies feeling the pain, either.

(Reuters) - Apple is expected to unveil at an event on Monday new Mac computers and possibly a new chip to power them as it gears up for a fresh bout of competition against Windows-based PCs with better battery life starting next year, analysts said.
The event, to be livestreamed at 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT Tuesday), comes as Apple has seen a revitalization in its Mac business, roughly doubling its market share to nearly 11% since 2020 when it parted ways with Intel and started using its own custom-designed chips as the brains of the machines, according to preliminary data from IDC. The event could include laptops and desktops.
Apple's custom chips, which use technology from Arm Holdings, have given its Macs better battery life and, for some tasks, better performance than machines using Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Apple's shakeup of the market has spurred Qualcomm to redouble its efforts to make Arm-based chips for Windows, and last week it said it plans to release a chip that is both faster and more energy efficient than some Apple offerings. Reuters last week reported that Nvidia also plans to jump into the PC market as early as 2025.
""The good thing here is, it feels like there's a competitive environment again on PC and Mac chips,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, who added that computer makers are racing to offer machines that can carry out artificial intelligence tasks like generating text and images.
At Apple, the Mac hit $40.18 billion in revenue for its fiscal 2022, or about 11% of its revenue. While that was up 14% from the previous fiscal year, sales this year have slowed along with the rest of the PC industry, which has suffered a post-pandemic slump.
Bajarin and other analysts expect Apple to debut on Monday a new chip called the M3, possibly with a few variants for higher performance. But it remains unclear how many models Apple will put the new chip into.
Analysts expect the M3 will be made with 3-nanometer manufacturing technology at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which uses the same technology to make chips for the top-end iPhone 15 models.
Bajarin said he thinks that supply constraints will lead Apple to focus on higher-end Mac models used by large businesses.
""Most likely, more than 50% of their user base is still Intel-based Macs"" and especially so among business users, Bajarin said. ""Everything will be oriented at getting that Intel base to upgrade.""

If you want to skip our introduction to the current drivers of stock market performance, then check out 5 Best Long-term Stocks To Buy For High Returns.
The stock market is made up of thousands of stocks. Each of these belongs to separate industries and categories, which, along with the firm's management and product strengths, determines how the shares will perform. The correct execution, lady luck, and broader economic prosperity carry the potential to skyrocket a stock to meteoric new highs within a couple of months.
In fact, we don't have to look too far back to find an example of this phenomenon since one such company has already bathed in returns this year. This firm is none other than the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up by a stunning 221% year to date after having added $316 to their value over the year. If you think these returns are 'meh' then consider the fact that before the mega cap sell off over the past couple of months, NVIDIA's shares were up by a stunning 245% year to August.
Naturally, these are returns that any investor would give an arm and a leg to add to their portfolio. So, the next question to ask is, why have NVIDIA's shares soared in 2023, and are there any broader principles that can be generalized and then applied to other companies to gauge whether they might also post similar share price performance? After all, even if we rewind the hands of time back for just 12 months, few people would be able to confidently assert that NVIDIA's market capitalization in October 2023 would be $1.1 trillion. The reason that NVIDIA's shares have performed well can be put into two words, 'Artificial Intelligence.' NVIDIA's GPUs have traditionally been used for gaming and data center use, and they have often delivered superior performance when compared to competitor products. The firm's strengths in designing powerful products and then managing a supply chain spanning from Asia to North America to sell the products have proven key to its share price performance in 2023 since it is the only one capable of providing high performance products for use in AI applications.
Right now, there are market forces in play that could affect stock returns over the long term. The stock market of the 2022 - 2023 era is fundamentally different from one that was in flow since the 2008 Great Recession. This is because the Federal Reserve had reduced rates since then to bring them to a paltry 0.25% before the recent interest rate hiking spree. While high rates and the stock market are typically talked about in tandem with the pain that businesses and consumers are going through, another key outcome of the higher rates is its effect on hedge funds. Higher rates increase the stakes for the funds since they are highly leveraged entities that borrow multiple times their investor funds to go all in on the stock markets. So, their investment climate becomes tough too, since brokers typically lend funds with rates that add a premium over the prevailing interbank rate.
Right now, U.S. interest rates sit at 5.25% - 5.50%, and as long as they remain high, hedge funds will have to think very carefully about where they invest and how much leverage they take. The less they borrow, the less they bet, and consequently, the stock market misses out on share price growth due to major buying activity. When coupled with the effects of the high interest rate on consumers, who typically see a drop in discretionary income, and on businesses, who have to face off with expensive debt and working capital financing, it's clear that the stock market of today has entered a new era when it comes to long term investing.
When it comes to sifting stocks for long term investing, one of the more popular approaches is picking growth stocks. Typically, growth stocks are defined as those whose share prices carry a hefty premium over their earnings per share if the company is profitable. This ratio is called the price to earnings ratio, and it measures the current share price and divides it by a firm's earnings per share for the last 12 months, the latest fiscal year, or its projected earnings per share. Companies with a high P/E ratio (relative to industry benchmarks) show that investors are paying much more for the stock than the EPS would justify, and the assumption behind this added value is that the stock will grow in the future and justify the current high price.
Today, we'll take a look at some great long term stocks to buy, with the top three picks being Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM).

NVDA,2023-11-03 22:52:59,"Artificial intelligence is old news, higher interest rates have slashed the appeal of stocks, and Big Tech isn't always honest, Bill Smead says.","The AI-fueled boom in the ""Magnificent 7"" tech stocks has propped up the stock market this year.
Bill Smead says the craze is overblown, and predicts pain once the handful of stocks capitulate.
AI is old news and higher interest rates have made stocks less appealing, the veteran investor says.
The buzz around artificial intelligence has boosted the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks this year, pulling the wider market higher. The frenzy seems overblown, and investors could suffer big losses once the hype fades, Bill Smead warned in a memo titled ""Artificial (Stock Market) Life Support"" this week.
""The whole thing looks very disingenuous to us,"" the Smead Capital Management president wrote. ""First, AI is not new, and they have all been working on it and using it in the last ten years,"" he said, referring to the group of seven Big Tech companies: Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia.
""Second, interest rates have risen substantially and make futuristic earnings on exciting technology less valuable by discounting those earnings back to today,"" Smead continued. ""Third, this group of companies has been famous for having a lack of forthrightness (just ask the Justice Department).""
The veteran investor noted that tech-industry stalwart IBM's AI system, Watson, was winning games of ""Jeopardy"" back in 2011. His comment about rates referred to the Federal Reserve hiking borrowing costs from almost zero to over 5% since last spring, which has bolstered returns from risk-free Treasuries and slashed the relative appeal of riskier assets like stocks. His third point was a nod to the US government's spate of legal challenges against the likes of Amazon and Alphabet.
Smead emphasized the Magnificent Seven are ""the only thing keeping the rally in the S&P 500 index alive this year."" He included a chart showing the 10 largest S&P 500 stocks by market cap have accounted for an unprecedented 96% of the index's performance for 2023.
""The success of this narrow group of stocks has defended the massive amount of capital stuck in the passive index and prevented it from fleeing,"" he said. In other words, if the handful of high fliers capitulate, investors would sour on stocks and pull their cash out of the market in his view.
""AI looks like tech stock and S&P 500 index life support to us,"" Smead said. ""What happens if the seven stocks that have propped up the passive S&P 500 Index go through what every stock of popularity has done historically? This is just another reason to fear stock market failure!""
The value investor has been raising the alarm about a historic bubble in stocks and a looming crash for a while. For example, he warned in August that the AI-fueled tech craze ""made the dot-com bubble look like small change.""","The AI craze is overblown - and the S&P 500 will suffer if the 'Magnificent 7' stocks falter, veteran investor warns",435.06,450.04999,457.51001,11,2023,3
NVDA,2023-11-06 19:51:19,"John Hussman rejected Richard Bernstein's idea of a ""once-in-a-generation"" chance to buy stocks, citing the S&P 500's returns over the past century.","Wall Street veteran Richard Bernstein sees a generational buying opportunity in US stocks.
Longtime strategist John Hussman dismissed the idea, pointing to historical S&P 500 returns.
Hussman has previously warned the benchmark index could plunge by 60% to about 1,600 points.
However, Hussman's negative outlooks have been consistently wrong in recent years.
A Wall Street veteran recently hailed a generational buying opportunity for US stock investors – but John Hussman, a longtime strategist and financial historian known for his pessimistic predictions, disagrees.
Richard Bernstein, the CEO and chief investor of Richard Bernstein Advisors, suggested in a note last week that there's a ""once-in-a-generation investment opportunity in virtually anything other than those 7 stocks."" He was referring to the ""Magnificent Seven"" – Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, and Nvidia.
The former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch pointed to the US economy's resilient growth despite the pressures of inflation and higher interest rates, and said he doesn't expect a downturn or recession.
While a handful of mega-cap technology stocks such as Tesla and Nvidia are trading at heady levels in his view, Bernstein expects the wider stock market to climb as valuations are fairer, there's an economic tailwind, and he believes corporate profits are accelerating and will surge next year.
Hussman, the head of Hussman Investment Trust, disagreed firmly when an X user asked for his reaction to Bernstein's call.
""Here's a century of data that might help to identify a generational opportunity,"" he posted on X Sunday. ""It's not on the buy side.""
""'Show your work' doesn't just apply to math tests,"" he added.
Hussman attached a chart comparing estimated and actual 12-year total returns from the S&P 500 in excess of Treasury bonds between 1928 and 2023. He singled out the latest datapoint, November 3, and his estimate that the index will underperform Treasuries by 7.4% over the next 12 years.
Hussman offered more context for his grim forecast in his latest research note. He included a chart showing his preferred valuation metric, the ratio of the market capitalization of all non-financial stocks and the gross value added from those stocks. The measure of stock-market value to productivity has a strong negative correlation with S&P 500 returns over time, and it's currently so high that it suggests the index will underperform in the years ahead.
""Current market valuations, even after the retreat since the beginning of 2022, rival the 1929 and 2000 bubble peaks,"" he wrote, adding that they ""stand at one of the three great bubble extremes in US history.""
""The problem is that the expansion in multiples was so extreme in the advancing phase of this bubble that likely 10-12 year S&P 500 total returns, by our estimates, are now negative,"" he added.
Hussman also flagged ""poor market internals"" in his latest research note, his firm's proprietary measure of investor sentiment that's historically correlated to abrupt sell-offs.
While Bernstein expects a strong economy to boost stocks, Hussman noted that underlying GDP growth, which takes into account growth in the labor force and productivity, has slowed from over 4% a year to below 2% today.
The pair seem to disagree on the outlook for equities over the next 12 years at least, given Bernstein sees a generational buying opportunity, whereas Hussman views stocks as extremely overvalued and anticipates a decade of stock-market underperformance.
However, they're far more aligned on the overvaluation of Big Tech stocks today. Hussman pointed out in recent note that the profit margins of the largest US stocks are no higher relative to the median stock than they've been in the past, and biggest mega-cap companies are growing more slowly as they've become more dominant. Similarly, Bernstein underscored in his recent note that his bullish market outlook excluded the Magnificent Seven.
Hussman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.
For the uninitiated, Hussman has repeatedly made headlines by predicting a stock-market decline exceeding 60% and forecasting a full decade of negative equity returns. And as the stock market continued to grind mostly higher, he has persisted with his doomsday calls.
However, it's worth noting that he correctly predicted the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 would plummet by over 80% once the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, and accurately forecasted that the S&P 500 would see negative total returns over the next decade. Moreover, he warned in April 2007 that the S&P 500 could tank by 40%, and the benchmark stock index fell as much as 55% between 2007 and 2009.",A market forecaster has been buzzing about a generational buying opportunity in stocks.

The surge has eclipsed the dot-com bubble highs from 2000 and the highs seen during the 1960s bull market.
Bank of America's Michael Hartnett credits the ""AI productivity miracle bull"" for tech's recent dominance.
Our Chart of the Day is from Bank of America, which highlighted the recent outperformance of technology stocks versus the S&P 500.
In fact, tech stocks just hit a record high relative to the S&P 500, eclipsing the dot-com bubble's peak in 2000 as well as the highs seen during the 1960s bull market.
The chart measures the relative price performance between technology stocks and the S&P 500. As the chart moves higher, it signals that tech stocks are outperforming the broader market, and vice versa when the chart is moving lower.
Bank of America investment strategist Michael Hartnett credited the ongoing outperformance in tech stocks to the ""AI productivity miracle bull.""
The tech rally was supercharged after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. That helped fuel a reversal of last year's bear market, with the Nasdaq 100 up 43% year-to-date.
Since ChatGPT was released, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF has jumped 47%, far outpacing the S&P 500's 18% gain over the same time period.
A lot of the bullishness has been driven by the idea that as the adoption of artificial intelligence grows, it will help fuel efficiencies and productivity gains that should boost profits over the long term.
And tech companies at the center of the AI boom — like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft, among others — are set to see a surge in business as they supply AI-related hardware and software to companies adopting the new technology.

NVDA,2023-11-08 11:00:39,Corporate America sounds the alarm bell on the economy and the deficit at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference.,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:
The chart of the day
What we're watching
What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
Big ideas, bold actions.
That was the theme of Yahoo Finance's Invest conference that happened live on Tuesday in New York City. The packed house indeed got access to big ideas, and also bold actions. Especially by the likes of ""Bond King"" Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine.
""The Magnificent Seven obviously will be the worst performer in the upcoming recession,"" Gundlach told me at the event, pointing to potential looming weakness in 2024 in favored stocks like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft.
""Whatever is leading the charge going into the economic downturn invariably must lead the charge on the way down. I would get out of them,"" Gundlach added. ""I would go into an equal-weighted basket as opposed to a market-weighted basket.""
In case you didn't get Gundlach's message, he is concerned on the economic outlook.
And so are consumers, as seen in a revealing new Yahoo Finance poll unveiled at the event by our Senior Columnist Rick Newman.
However, the C-suite was cautiously optimistic on 2024 overall — not too jazzed up, not too gloomy. And while there was targeted optimism (Candle Media's CEO Kevin Mayer, an adviser to Disney CEO Bob Iger, seemed optimistic on Iger turning around Disney) business's heavy hitters levied some specific concerns throughout the day.
Here's a check in on the vibe in the C-suite as 2023 draws to a close...
Marriott CEO Anthony Capuano on higher interest rates and real estate
""I think it's less about the elevated interest rate environment and a little more about expectations on the retail sector, that there will be increasing liquidity requirements on lenders. I am worried about the office sector and I am worried about the retail sector.""
DoubleLine founder & CEO Jeffrey Gundlach on the economy
""We have a lot of major indicators that have been in recessionary signaling for a year plus. And so I think the Fed has stopped raising interest rates. I don't think they will do it again. That is clearly the message from the bond market. The thing that worries me the most is the concept of higher-for-longer rates. And not so much for the economy. But because once the economy starts to noticeably weaken, it seems like is almost happening in real time, the Fed will cut interest rates.""
AT&T CEO John Stankey on the deficit
""I think it's [the deficit] a problem today. I don't think it's a problem 30 years from now. What a day reckoning is constituted by, I don't know that we can pick a day and say things are going to trip. I think the day of reckoning is we'll end up in a prolonged period of sub-optimal growth. You can even go a step further and say if you don't get your fiscal house in order, does it challenge your ability to grow the economy fast enough to be able to things to have influence outside the US and make sure the world stays safe.""
Economist Nouriel Roubini on the Fed's actions
""The question is whether the economy will have a soft landing where you go back to 2% inflation without any recession, or whether there would be a soft-ish, bumpy landing with 2% inflation and you will have a short and shallow recession. I would say the jury is still out on that. The economy right now looks like in the direction of a soft landing, but interest rates are higher and higher for longer slows the economy down.""

NVDA,2023-11-08 17:20:21,"AI may change the ways of Hollywood, but it won't take the role of actors and writers.","In Hollywood, fears about AI have been widespread among striking actors and writers. But the alarm may be misplaced.
""It's important to understand that technology always augments humans, and the story of Hollywood has been marred by moments like this before,"" Cristóbal Valenzuela, CEO of AI video company Runway, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference on Tuesday.
Runway, which develops generative AI tools focused on film and image, is valued at a reported $1.5 billion. It has the backing of big-name investors, including Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Salesforce (CRM) Ventures.
In June, the company raised $141 million in a Series C round. Its technology is built for creatives, including advertisers, photographers, and – of course – filmmakers.
History suggests that advancements in technology won't ultimately put humans in Tinseltown out of work, said Valenzuela. He points to the evolution of movie music as a key example. In the silent film era, orchestras played in movie theaters. When movies with sound emerged, famously called ""talkies,"" those orchestras went out of fashion — but an entire industry surrounding movie music and soundtracks began to build.
""It's not about replacing the industry, but about augmenting processes and changing them,"" said Valenzuela. ""So, I think the key factor now, and how I spend most of my time these days specifically in Hollywood, is helping transition into that.""
Much of the fear — and excitement — surrounding AI links back to how fast the technology is advancing, as popularity of ChatGPT has spurred a boom in generative AI in the past year. The rapid rate of development has been especially true in AI-generated video. If you were to compare it to the early days of photography, Runway's AI models ""were in the 1900s just two years ago, and now we're entering the 1980s of the camera revolution,"" said Valenzuela.
Unease surrounding AI goes beyond Hollywood. As the US heads into an election year, AI-powered video is widely considered to be a growing and alarming misinformation risk.
Valenzeula said that the technology to do this, CGI, has been in place for years. His view is that AI leaders should ensure the output of their AI models are used appropriately, while bad actors or videos should be restricted. However, fears about fake videos should not result in constraints on technological advancements, he added.
Ultimately, the concerns and possibilities around AI video — and AI overall — seem to be in flux because we're fundamentally still in very early days. That especially applies to Runway's AI models and the company overall, said Valenzuela.

The startup, 01.AI, bought enough of the chips to last for the next 18 months or so, founder and Chief Executive Officer Kai-Fu Lee said. Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are considered the most advanced for training AI models, like OpenAI’s GPT4.
“We have stockpiled a lot of Nvidia chips,” said Lee, during a Bloomberg Television interview on the sidelines of Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum. The 61-year-old, who is also CEO of venture capital fund Sinovation Ventures, founded 01.AI earlier this year and helped push its valuation to more than $1 billion in less than eight months.
China’s Communist Party is leading an investment blitz to develop its own advanced semiconductor capabilities as the US government cuts off the supply of chips and chip-making equipment, but Lee said it’s unclear whether the country can build the requisite technologies before companies like his run out of foreign supplies. Semiconductors are at the foundation of the technology industry, the essential building blocks for everything from AI and smartphones to military applications.
“The jury is out on whether China in 1.5 years can make equivalent or nearly as good chips,” said Lee, a four-decade veteran of AI who previously worked at Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Google’s China unit.
He called the rising tensions between the US and China regrettable, and predicted it would further divide the technology world.
“We will have two parallel universes,” he said. “Americans will supply their products and technologies to the US and other countries and Chinese companies will build for China and whoever else uses Chinese products. The reality is that they will not compete very much in the same marketplace.”
01.AI just introduced an open-source large language model called Yi-34B, which outperformed leading open-source rivals such as Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama 2 on certain metrics, according to Hugging Face rankings. The startup anticipates offering proprietary versions of the LLM to paying customers, as well as applications, so it can generate revenue in the future.
“We expect very significant revenue next year” after “next to zero” this year, Lee said in a separate interview at the event.
Building AI models is very expensive, Lee said, because you have to spend millions on chips to make technology better. But there’s no alternative because there is a direct correlation between money spent on GPUs and the performance of products. 01.AI raised money from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud unit and borrowed from Sinovation ahead of that to buy chips.
“The best strategy is to be on a constant, rolling fundraising for large language model generative AI companies,” he said. “Every time money’s being raised a significant portion, perhaps three quarters, are being put into buying GPUs.”
“We as mankind have never seen a technology which automatically becomes smarter every time you throw more GPUs at it,” Lee said. “That is a constant, never ending. And as long as that GPU is being translated into more intelligence, and as long as the more intelligence is being translated to profitable applications, the virtuous cycle continues.”

The new model, called the H200, will get the ability to use high-bandwidth memory, or HBM3e, allowing it to better cope with the large data sets needed for developing and implementing AI, Nvidia said Monday. Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud and Oracle Corp.’s Cloud Infrastructure have all committed to using the new chip starting next year.
The current version of the Nvidia processor — known as an AI accelerator — is already in famously high demand. It’s a prized commodity among technology heavyweights like Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, who boast about their ability to get their hands on the chip. But the product is facing more competition: Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is bringing its rival MI300 chip to market in the fourth quarter, and Intel Corp. claims that its Gaudi 2 model is faster than the H100.
With the new product, Nvidia is trying to keep up with the size of data sets used to create AI models and services, it said. Adding the enhanced memory capability will make the H200 much faster at bombarding software with data — a process that trains AI to perform tasks such as recognizing images and speech.
“When you look at what’s happening in the market, model sizes are rapidly expanding,” said Dion Harris, who oversees Nvidia’s data center products. “It’s another example of us continuing to swiftly introduce the latest and greatest technology.”
Large computer makers and cloud service providers are expected to start using the H200 in the second quarter of 2024.
Read More: What’s the H100, the Chip Driving Generative AI?
Nvidia got its start making graphics cards for gamers, but its powerful processors have now won a following among data center operators. That division has gone from being a side business to the company’s biggest moneymaker in less than five years.
Nvidia’s graphics chips helped pioneer an approach called parallel computing, where a massive number of relatively simple calculations are handled at the same time. That’s allowed it win major orders from data center companies, at the expense of traditional processors supplied by Intel.
The growth helped turn Nvidia into the poster child for AI computing earlier this year — and sent its market valuation soaring. The Santa Clara, California-based company became the first chipmaker to be worth $1 trillion, eclipsing the likes of Intel.
Read More: Nvidia Warns of Product Snags From Tightening US Chip Rules
Still, it’s faced challenges this year, including a crackdown on the sale of AI accelerators to China. The Biden administration has sought to limit the flow of advanced technology to that country, hurting Nvidia’s sales in the world’s biggest market for chips.
The rules barred the H100 and other processors from China, but Nvidia has been developing new AI chips for the market, according to a report from local media last week.
Nvidia will give investors a clearer picture of the situation next week. It’s slated to report earnings on Nov. 21.

The cloud arms of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMNZ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) will be among the first to offer the new GPUs next year.
Nvidia Is Bringing The AI Chip Game To The Next Level
With 141GB of next generation “HBM3” memory, the H200 brings the ability to generate text, images or predictions using AI models. This new GPU is an upgrade from the H100 which Microsoft-backed OpenAI used to train its most advanced large language model, GPT-4. Based on a test in which it used Llama 2 LLM by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia said the H200 will generate output nearly twice as fast as the H100.
AMD And Its AI Chip Candidate
AMD is bringing a new chip that holds the promise of catching up to Nvidia. But it is unknown how will the upcoming AMD-made MI300 stand against Nvidia’s revised H200. The MI300 that AMD is developing is similar to the H200with additional memory over its predecessors that empower it to fit big models on the hardware to run inference.
Nvidia Powered HP To Deliver A Supercomputing Solution
With Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE: HPE) announced a supercomputing solution to accelerate GenAI training that will be superpowered by Nvidia Grace Hopper GH200 Superchips.

The supercomputing “turkey” solution for GenAI that Nvidia and HP developed promises to accelerating training speeds by two to three times. It will be generally available in December 2023.
The H200 and high-end AI products that Nvidia is planning to release in 2024 and 2025 is certainly bad news for its AI chip rivals and good news for GenAI development. Nvidia is set to host a conference call regarding its fiscal third quarter results on November 21st.

A lawsuit filed on Monday accuses the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY) and more than two dozen brokerages and companies of conspiring to artificially inflate commissions paid to agents who help sell residential real estate in Manhattan. The proposed class action against the REBNY trade group, the Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman and others followed an Oct. 31 verdict by a federal jury in Missouri awarding home sellers $1.78 billion, in a similar case against the National Association of Realtors and several brokerages. That verdict, which a judge can triple to more than $5.3 billion, could upend decades-old practices that require sellers to pay commissions to buyers' brokers.

(Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday added new features to its top-of-the-line chip for artificial intelligence, saying the new offering will start to roll out next year with Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Oracle.
The H200, as the chip is called, will overtake Nvidia's current top H100 chip. The primary upgrade is more high-bandwidth memory, one of the costliest parts of the chip that defines how much data it can process quickly.
Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips and powers OpenAI's ChatGPT service and many similar generative AI services that respond to queries with human-like writing. The addition of more high-bandwidth memory and a faster connection to the chip's processing elements means that such services will be able to spit out an answer more quickly.
The H200 has 141-gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory, up from 80 gigabyte in its previous H100. Nvidia did not disclose its suppliers for the memory on the new chip, but Micron Technology said in September that it was working to become an Nvidia supplier.
Nvidia also buys memory from Korea's SK Hynix, which said last month that AI chips are helping to revive sales.
Nvidia on Wednesday said that Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first cloud service providers to offer access to H200 chips, in addition to specialty AI cloud providers CoreWeave, Lambda and Vultr.

Britain's budget update is in the spotlight, while the yen might get some breathing space and Argentina heads for a key election.
Here's your week ahead in world markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, and Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.
1/ BARGAIN HUNTING
The crucial holiday shopping season kicks off with Black Friday on Nov. 24 at a time when investors are questioning whether the consumer-driven U.S. economy can remain resilient.
This year's Black Friday comes as Americans grapple with soaring interest rates and inflation that, while easing, remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Already, data for October showed U.S. retail sales fell, pointing to slowing demand, although the decline was less than expected.
There's also likely to be plenty of interest in chip company Nvidia, which releases its latest earnings report on Nov. 21. It is the last of the results in the earnings season from the Magnificent 7 megacap companies, whose massive share gains this year have led equity indexes higher.
2/ SOFT VS HARD
Soft or hard landing? For sure, compelling arguments can be made for both. The European Commission expects the euro zone will avoid technical recession; Britain just sidestepped the start of one.
The forward-looking flash November PMIs due out globally should help investors assess recession risks and how quickly rate cuts will begin.
The euro zone PMI is already below the 50 number, suggesting economic activity is contracting. It is the same in Britain, while the U.S. Oct manufacturing PMI contracted sharply.
Bond heavyweight PIMCO sees the probability of a U.S. recession within one year at 50%. Market pricing for rate cuts suggests traders reckon economic growth will slow fast enough for the Fed and European Central Bank to switch to easing mode. And of course soft landing hopes could vanish fast if inflation eases more quickly and unemployment rises fast.
3/ 11 DOWNING STREET
UK politics has been dramatic, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak having fired his interior minister, moved former leader David Cameron back into government and reshuffled other top roles.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt will now change gear with his Nov. 22 Autumn Statement, focusing on boosting growth ahead of an expected 2024 election.
Analysts predict the government, hamstrung by a stagnant economy and high debt, won't make big investment pledges.
Still, Hunt looks set to trim taxes for voters and businesses, offering some relief to the many Conservative lawmakers alarmed at the opposition Labour Party's big opinion poll lead. He could also downgrade near-term borrowing expectations, temporarily boosting gilts.
Natwest says the UK may issue 10% more debt in 2024-2025 than in this fiscal year - a development that would amplify long-term concerns about gilt market oversupply.
4/ DEATH, TAXES, WEAK YEN
There's an air of inevitability about a weaker yen, even with the Bank of Japan increasingly hinting at an end to ultra-loose policy and greater investor certainty that the Fed is done tightening.
After pulling back from the brink of 152 per dollar at the start of the week, receiving a lifeline from cooling U.S. inflation data, the yen was back to the weaker side of 151 a day later. It's déjà vu for traders, who saw support from weak U.S. payrolls numbers on Nov. 3 last only as long as the weekend.
While gaping Japan-U.S. rate differentials do not bode well for the yen, the shift in policy directions should at least give forward-thinking markets some pause.
As long as that's not the case, pressure is on the Kishida cabinet since a weak yen is unpopular politically. And that means Tokyo is never too far from the intervention trigger.
5/ PHOTO FINISH?
Argentines elect a new president on Sunday in a closely fought race pitching center-left Peronist economy chief Sergio Massa against libertarian outsider Javier Milei and polls suggest a likely photo finish.
They offer two wildly different visions for South America's No. 2 economy: Milei's potentially painful shock therapy for the embattled country that has run out of FX reserves, inflation running at over 140% and faces recession. Pragmatist Massa pledges a unity government and more gradual change to solve the crisis that has worsened on his watch.
Investors are bracing for rocky times, with Argentina's crucial $44 billion IMF programme on the ropes and international bonds priced at deeply distressed levels.
And there's more election-induced volatility ahead in emerging markets with Egypt, Taiwan, South Africa and India just some facing key ballots in coming months.

Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Friday as Treasury yields extended declines from the previous session, and as weak recent economic data cemented hopes that the Federal Reserve is most likely done raising interest rates.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq eked out marginal gains on Thursday on falling Treasury yields after higher-than-expected jobless claims supported some megacap stocks, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note further easing on Friday, last at 4.3849%.
Some megacap stocks edged up in premarket trading, with Amazon.com and Nvidia up 0.6% and 0.5% respectively.
Wall Street's three main indexes were poised to gain about 2% for the week, also on course for their third straight week of gains, as multiple data, including the consumer and producer prices index, pointed towards easing inflationary pressures.

""Currently, bad news is good news as the market focus is on central banks becoming more accommodative,"" Mohit Kumar, chief Europe economist at Jefferies, said in a note.
While money markets have fully priced in the Fed will hold rates steady at the current 5.25%-5.50% level in its December meeting, they also see a near 69% chance of at least a 25 basis point rate cut in May 2024, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

The Cloud Intelligence Group Will Not Be Publicly Listed Due To U.S. Chip Export Restrictions
Alibaba revealed it will not be listing its cloud computing segment that is the infrastructure of the digital economy due to U.S. chip curbs. The U.S. made it harder for Chinese companies to get their chip supplies from U.S. companies by restricting exports, harming Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its advanced AI-focused hips, H800 and A800 and creating uncertainties also for prospects of Alibaba’s cloud arm due to which the Chinese titan decided to shelve its spinoff plan.
Quarterly Highlights
For the quarter that ended on September 30th, Alibaba reported revenue rose 9% YoY to 224.79 billion yuan (31.47 billion) which met expectations with net income attributable to shareholders of 27.7 billion yuan ($3.8 billion). Yet, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai assured that the company has never been in a better financial position to invest in its business growth as it ended the quarter with $63 billion in net cash.
Alibaba has flagged the impact of U.S. chip curbs, with its stock plummeting as a result. As for its quarterly report that is viewed as an indication of the health of Chinese consumers, its bottom line came short of estimates but its top line was in line with what analysts were expecting. All in all, although there was no boom after Covid-19 lockdowns ended due to other structural challenges and a property crisis that tempered with China’s recovery, Tsai did say that despite the global uncertainty, the operating environment has improved and is more stable. Alibaba also revealed it recorded healthy YoY user growth of its Taobao and Tmall domestic online shopping sites.CEO Eddie Yongming WU stated that going forward, Alibaba will be performing a strategic review of its businesses in order to separate core businesses that demand a long-term focus and commitment from noncore operations.
AI Is At The Heart Of Its Strategic Direction
Alibaba did state that AI is a big part of its strategy going forward, but that front is already crowded with competition from Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY) and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU), as well as U.S. tech titans, namely Amazon, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI. Interestingly, Baidu who is among the leading AI firms, warned this week about the consequences of China’s rush to develop AI models. On Wednesday, Baidu CEO Robin Li warned that all that rush to develop large language models could result in a waste of resources. Baidu CEO advised companies to focus on developing practical applications as many companies who are developing these models have yet to find viable business models. Last month, Baidu revealed the newest version of its generative AI model Ernie 4.0. Also, Baidu opened Ernie for public use back in August. AI is a big part of Alibaba’s cloud computing unit so perhaps this is why the unexpected announcement of a ditched spinoff overshadowed its quarterly results that were not at all bad.

The weak guidance overshadowed quarterly results, with shares of the networking giant falling as much as 13% upon Wednesday’s report.
Fiscal First Quarter Highlights
For the quarter ended on October 28th, revenue rose 7.6% YoY to $14.67 billion.
Networking hardware maker earned a net income of $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, up from last year’s comparable quarter when it made $2.67 billion, or 65 cents per share. After strong delivery figures over the previous three quarters, new product orders slowed down with consumers being busy installing and implementing the products they received. Cisco projected that one or two quarters of shipped products are waiting to be implemented.
During the reported quarter, Cisco announced it intends to acquire Splunk, a data analytics software maker, for $28 billion. It also reported it partnered with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) to unleash the power of hybrid workplaces. More precisely, it unveiled the next milestone of its ongoing work with Nvidia that aims to deliver AI-powered meetings to hybrid workers. Cisco announced the launch of Room Kit EQX and the expansion of its Cinematic Meetings capabilities which are both powered by an AI engine that Nvidia developed. Together with Nvidia, Cisco is pioneering the use of AI to enhance workplace collaboration. With Nvidia, Cisco is reimagining its device portfolio to offer solutions for any cost point.
Guidance
For the fiscal second quarter, Cisco guided for adjusted earnings of 82 cents to 84 cents per share with revenue in the range between $12.6 billion and $12.8 billion which translates to a 6.6% revenue decline. These projections were below LSEG’s estimates for EPS and revenue that are 99 cents and $14.19 billion, respectively.
Cisco also lowered its full-year guidance for revenue but lifted its earnings outlook. It guided for EPS in the range between $3.87 and $3.93 with a revenue range between $53.8 billion and $55.0 billion.
As for the 2025 fiscal year, Cisco is confident of gaining $1 billion worth of AI infrastructure orders from cloud providers. But with its latest report that even had better-than-expected results, Cisco threw a monkey wrench into the ongoing tech rebound story with its weak guidance that shows its consumers already have the networking gear they need.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nvidia has told customers in China it is delaying the launch of a new artificial intelligence chip it designed to comply with U.S. export rules until the first quarter of next year, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The delayed chip is the H20, the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia has developed to comply with fresh U.S. export restrictions, the sources said, and could complicate its efforts to preserve market share in China against local rivals like Huawei.
The California-based AI chip giant had been expected to launch the new products as early as Nov. 16, chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported this month.
However, the H20 launch has now been pushed back until the first quarter of next year, the sources said, with one saying they were advised it could take place in February or March.
Both sources declined to be named as the information was confidential. Nvidia declined to comment.
The sources said they were told that the H20 was being delayed due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.
In addition to the H20, Nvidia has been planning two other chips to comply with new U.S. export rules - the L20 and L2. The sources said the L20 was not facing delays and would launch according to its original schedule. They were unable to share information on the status of the L2.
Nvidia is betting on the chips to help it preserve its market share in China after it was barred from shipping products including its advanced A800 and H800 AI chips by Washington's tightened export rules.
The A800 and H800 were introduced as alternatives for Chinese customers in November 2022, about a month after the U.S. first banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to China.
The H20, L20 and L2 include most of Nvidia's newest features for AI work, but have had some of their computing power measures cut back to comply with new U.S. rules, according to SemiAnalysis' analysis of the chips' specifications.
The U.S. export curbs have created an opportunity for rivals such as Huawei to win orders that may have otherwise gone to Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the AI market.
Chinese internet giant Baidu placed a sizeable order for Huawei AI chips this year, Reuters reported this month citing sources. One source said Baidu had done so before the U.S. curbs were announced because it was preparing for a future when it would no longer be able to purchase from Nvidia.

To skip the detailed analysis of how the sectors performed in 2023, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks In Each Sector.
The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) was developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International [now MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI)]. It is a framework that classifies and categorizes companies into different industry groups based on their primary business activities. The GICS has a hierarchical structure with four tiers, which are sectors, industry groups, industries, and sub-industries, written in order.
According to GICS, there are 11 sectors, which include energy, materials, industrials, consumer discretionary, consumer cyclical, healthcare, financials, information technology, communication services, utilities, and real estate. These sectors are further divided into 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries.
In 2023, the technology sector took the whole market by storm. Generative AI trends proved to be quite beneficial for the sector. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 37.34% year-to-date (YTD), compared to 19.15% YTD gains of the S&P 500 index on November 22. However, it is important to note that these gains are attributed to the companies that fall within the communication services and IT sectors. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) is up nearly 50% YTD. Among the tech stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the performer of the year as the company touched the trillion-dollar market cap mark at the end of May, and its stock price is up over 240% YTD.
The worst-performing sectors have been healthcare and utilities. The healthcare sector is down 7.46 % YTD, while the utilities sector showed a decline of -5.90%. As per our previous report, the solar power segment among the utilities sector has been one of the worst performing industries in the market, as Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) was down nearly 45% by the end of October. Nevertheless, November has been a better month for the industry as the ETF has gained around 6.5% since our article was posted. The financial sector hasn’t performed well either in the growing interest rate environment. Even though the sector as a whole still has positive YTD growth, the banking industry was hit quite roughly in 2023 due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) is down nearly 24%. Similar to the Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS), the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) has also made significant gains in November as the fund is up 11.32% month-to-date.
Market Conditions in Q3 and Future Forecast
In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 gained nearly 16.4%, including an 8% gain in the second quarter. These gains proved to be damaging for pessimistic investors. The “Big Short” investor, Michael Burry shorted the stock market in Q2 and placed an $887 million bet against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and $738 million against Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the NASDAQ 100. The investor closed these positions in the third quarter after a probable 40% loss. Nevertheless, Burry found new targets to short in the third quarter, and he opened $47.365 million worth of PUT options against the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF and $7.709 million against Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG).
Compared to the first half of the year, the third quarter was less than favorable for the stock market. While the S&P 500 was up 3.11% in July, August and September showed declines of 1.77% and 4.87%, respectively. The total Q3 decline for the S&P 500 was recorded at 3.65%. It further declined by 2.20% in October but is up 7.52% month-to-date on November 22. Energy was the best-performing sector in Q3 due to an increase in prices caused by OPEC and Russia supply cuts and geopolitical tensions caused by the Israel-Hamas conflict. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up nearly 11.4% in the quarter. Two of the best-performing energy stocks were Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), gaining nearly 30% and 26%, respectively.
However, the rest of the market did not perform well. The real estate sector has been one of the worst performing sectors throughout the year and declined by 9.7% in the third quarter, while the utilities sector was down 10.1%. Even the Invesco QQQ ETF, which has been performing really well across the year and is up 47.5% YTD, declined by 3% in the third quarter.
According to a Bloomberg report, Bank of America believes that the S&P 500 index will rise around 10% from November 22 levels by the end of 2024 and close at a record 5,000. The BofA team led by Savita Subramanian wrote:
""The market has absorbed significant geopolitical shocks already and the good news is we're talking about the bad news.""
The firm further added:
""Macro signals are muddled, but idiosyncratic alpha increased this year. We're bullish not because we expect the Fed to cut, but because of what the Fed has accomplished. Companies have adapted (as they are wont to do) to higher rates and inflation.""
On the pessimistic side, Morgan Stanley doesn’t believe that the market will go up from the current levels and set the S&P 500’s 2024 target at 4,500. Goldman Sachs has a slightly better outlook at 4,700. Wells Fargo has a target between 4,600 to 4,800, and UBS keeps it at 4,700 by the end of next year.
Keeping the market conditions and forecasts in perspective, some of the best stocks to buy from different sectors include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

Over the last three months, 18 Wall Street analysts covered NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)’s stock, and 14 analysts kept a Buy rating on the shares. Their average price target of $70.81 represents an upside of 23.21% as of the November 22 market close.
On November 6, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced that it has agreed to sell NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP)’s south Texas natural gas pipeline assets to push the company to reach its real zero 2040 goal. Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) has agreed to buy STX Midstream for $1.815 billion in cash and short-term borrowings.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are the best stocks in their respective sectors to buy along with NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).
Madison Investments mentioned NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:
“Although NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) reported an in-line second quarter, the stock has been weak primarily because of rising interest rates. NextEra also reported slower renewables backlog growth than expected. We do not view this as an issue as we expect the development pipeline timeline may not be as predictable as investors would like. The environment for renewables remains favorable both from a demand perspective as well as cost perspective.”
10. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)
Market Sector: Real Estate
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60
American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a Massachusetts-based real estate investment trust that leases broadcast communications infrastructure and offers optimization of wireless communication networks.
On November 10, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) announced that it will strengthen its position in Africa as its subsidiary, ATC Africa, entered into a multi-year agreement with MTN Nigeria. Under the agreement, ATC Africa will provide MTN Nigeria with new tenancies, which is estimated to improve wireless connectivity across Nigeria.
On October 26, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) reported Q3 funds from operations (FFO) of $2.58 per share and revenue of $2.82 billion, which beat the analysts’ estimates by $0.07 and $60 million, respectively. The quarter’s property revenue grew by 7.0% to nearly $2.82 billion, while the adjusted EBITDA saw a growth of 10.4% to $1.8 billion.
American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) was mentioned in Andvari Associates’ third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:
“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. These include companies like American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) and Digital Bridge. American Tower is a REIT (real estate investment trust) that owns and leases antennae space on cell towers while Digital Bridge is an investment manager that invests in the digital infrastructure space. Both companies require debt in their operations and the prospect of higher interest rates continues to impact share prices in the short term.
As an aside, American Tower is not a new holding of Andvari. We’ve owned it in the past. Although we may have started putting American Tower back into client portfolios a bit early, we believe shares are extremely attractive. First, the shares trade at a current 3.8% dividend yield at the end of October. This yield is near the highest in American’s entire history as a public company. Second, the company will likely grow dividends per share by 9% annually over the long term. As a nice kicker, Andvari believes American Tower will sell its assets in India before year’s end, which will free up capital it can use to pay off debt and repurchase shares.”

NVIDIA's estimated fair value is US$366 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
NVIDIA's US$487 share price signals that it might be 33% overvalued
The US$653 analyst price target for NVDA is 79% more than our estimate of fair value
In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
View our latest analysis for NVIDIA
The Model
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$360b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$77b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.2%) = US$1.2t
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.2t÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$544b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$904b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$487, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
Important Assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.269. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
SWOT Analysis for NVIDIA
Strength
Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.
Debt is not viewed as a risk.
Weakness
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.
Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.
Threat
No apparent threats visible for NVDA.
Looking Ahead:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

(Reuters) - An exchange-traded fund tracking artificial intelligence stocks saw investors pouring money after six straight weeks of outflows, on the backdrop of strong quarterly results by chipmaker Nvidia and rising optimism that U.S. interest rates have peaked.
The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF received $35.5 million in net inflows in the week ending on Wednesday, its strongest since June earlier this year, according to Lipper data.
ETFs tracking AI stocks had a strong start to the year sparked by the viral success of ChatGPT, till the rally sputtered after June on fears that persistently high U.S. interest rates will hurt the valuations of technology companies.
The growing prospect of a rapid flip to rate cuts by the Federal Reserve next year also has driven investors into beaten-down Treasuries, pushing Treasury yields down and boosting rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks.
""Improved inflation data and the likelihood of rate cuts in the second half of 2024 have maintained market optimism throughout November, contributing to investor interest,"" said Tejas Dessai, AVP, Research Analyst at Global X.
""In general, Generative AI is rapidly transitioning from experimentation to adoption to monetization, and we are beginning to see tangible revenue and profit opportunities emerge.""
So far this year, the Global X fund has gained 27.7% year-to-date, supported by the 233% rally in shares of its top holding Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI.
The chipmaker's strong results on Tuesday have also been an important factor in driving sentiment around AI ETFs, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA.
Daily inflows into the fund were $17.2 million on Wednesday, hitting their highest level in more than two months after Nvidia forecast overall revenue above Wall Street targets as supply-chain issues ease.
The Global X fund, which has total net assets of $2.2 billion, has seen net inflows of $554.8 million so far this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Regulators in the European Union, China and France have asked for information on Nvidia's graphic cards, with more requests expected in the future, the U.S. chip giant said in a regulatory filing.
Nvidia is the world's largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics. Demand for its chips jumped following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT late last year.
The California-based company has a market share of around 80% via its chips and other hardware and its powerful software that runs them.
Its graphics cards (GPUs) are high-performance devices that enable powerful graphics rendering and processing for use in video editing, video gaming and other complex computing operations.
The company said this has attracted regulatory interest around the world.
""For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets,"" Nvidia said in a regulatory filing dated Nov. 21.
The French watchdog raided Nvidia's local office in September, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters.
""We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our sales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future,"" Nvidia said in the filing.
Separately, Nvidia has delayed the launch of a new China-focused AI chip, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

NVDA,2023-11-24 17:24:00,"Nvidia earnings review, plus a cheaper semiconductor stock investors can consider","Nvidia NVDA reported earnings Tuesday after the market closed, and once again it has beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom line.
Although it seems many traders believe Nvidia’s valuation has reached bubble-like territory, a closer look at the data should reveal that it is still very much based in reality. The company has more than tripled its sales in the last year and still has a major edge in the AI infrastructure space, which is likely to remain in hyper growth.
However, if the recent NVDA earnings aren’t enough to convince you to buy the stock, I will also share a relatively cheap semiconductor stock, that is also likely to benefit over the coming months and years.
Earnings
Sales of $18.12 billion in the quarter came in 12.5% above analysts' expectations and showed a 34% QoQ increase and a 206% YoY increase. Data center revenue was the major contributor at $14.5 billion and grew a whopping 279% YoY.
EPS of $4.02 per share were 18.7% above estimates and were up nearly 6x from a year ago and up 49% from the previous quarter.
The AI revolution continues, and CEO Jensen Huang noted that “Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI… NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle. The era of generative AI is taking off.”
Nvidia enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.
Valuation
Today, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 50x, which is above the industry average of 46.7x, and below its five-year median of 55.6x. Also worth noting is that FY24 ends in February 2024, meaning FY25, or the forward multiple will shift in just a few months.
So, if we were to use FY25 earnings estimates of $16.60 per share, NVDA is actually trading at just 30x forward earnings!

Hedge Funds Still Long
Another interesting piece of information is that two of the most respectable traders on Wall Street continue to hold Nvidia stock as a major holding in their portfolios. According to the most recent 13f documents, Stanley Druckenmiller still holds NVDA as the largest equity holding in his portfolio at 13.65% of the total.
Additionally, David Tepper has Nvidia stock as the fourth largest holding at 8.8% of the total portfolio.
Semiconductor Industry
But let’s say you just can’t see yourself buying Nvidia stock, I understand. It has every eyeball in the market on it, so you think all the good news is priced in.
The good news is that the broader semiconductor industry still looks extremely compelling. The Semiconductor ETF SMH just printed all-time highs this week, demonstrating broad strength across the sector.
Image Source: TradingView
One semiconductor stock that jumps out to me is Super Micro Computer SMCI, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating but has indeed experienced some strong earnings revisions in the last month. Current quarter earnings estimates have increased 21% over the last month and FY24 by 8.6%.
Super Micro Computer is also projecting huge sales and earnings growth in the coming year, with current quarter sales and earnings expected to climb 55% and 40% YoY respectively and FY24 sales and earnings to grow 47% and 43% YoY.
Furthermore, the company is trading at a forward earnings multiple of just 17x and has been building out a convincing technical chart pattern over the last six months. If SMCI price can breakout from the bull flag, it very likely begins another major move higher.

Final Thoughts
As I noted, many traders feel that Nvidia stock has gotten too far ahead of its skis and is untouchable, and although that is debatable, the stock and industry continue to trudge higher.
The economy is strong, interest rates are likely to fall over the next year, and semiconductors are only becoming a more critical piece of infrastructure in the modern world.
There is often a long list of reasons why investors should be cautious about the future, but markets almost always climb that wall of worry, leaving the bears behind.

NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) -
U.S. stocks ended little changed in holiday-shortened trading on Friday, with low volume and conviction as investors watched the start of the seasonal shopping season for signs of consumer resiliency.
The S&P 500 closed essentially unchanged, while the Dow eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq was dragged slightly lower by weakness in megacap momentum stocks.
All three indexes notched their fourth consecutive weekly gains.
""We had mixed macroeconomic data and the post-Thanksgiving session is only half a day, so there aren't that many participants,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""But we're seeing a market that's on the right path of a year-end rally.""
Retailers around the world were attempting to attract millions of shoppers, many offering steep ""Black Friday"" discounts the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
""Consumers are being very frugal and while they might spend, they're looking for bargains,"" Cardillo added. ""The higher cost of money is hitting consumers' pocketbook.""
A survey by NRF, a U.S. retail trade group, showed U.S. shoppers are planning to spend an average of $875 on holiday purchases this year, an annual increase of about 5%.
S&P Global's advance purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed steady U.S. business activity in November, but private sector employment declined for the first time in almost 3-1/2 years, possibly due to the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy.
Next week's most anticipated data include the Commerce Department's second estimate on third-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, followed on Friday by its wide-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which will provide further clues on the extent of the Fed's rate-hike impact.
The focus has increasingly shifted to the likely timing of the U.S. central bank's first rate cut, which will be largely determined by the rate at which inflation cools down toward the Fed's average 2% target.
New and pending home sales, home prices, consumer prices and ISM PMI are also expected next week.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.58 points, or 0.33%, to 35,390.61, the S&P 500 gained 2.72 points, or 0.06%, to 4,559.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.00 points, or 0.11%, to 14,250.86.

After beating earnings estimates on Monday, here are three stocks to consider as these companies look poised to take market share in their respective industries.
Central Garden & Pet CENT
Central Garden & Pet’s fiscal fourth quarter tends to be a down period for the company but was able to post exhilarating Q4 results as one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies, lawn, and garden supplies space.
Fourth quarter earnings of $0.10 per share reassuringly surpassed expectations of $0.08 a share and soared from an adjusted loss of -$0.04 a share in the prior-year quarter. Plus, Q4 sales of $750.15 million beat estimates by 2% and rose 6% from $707.44 million a year ago.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Looking ahead, annual earnings are forecasted to be up 3% in Central Garden’s current fiscal 2024 and rise another 7% in FY25 to $2.86 per share. More appealing is that Central Garden’s stock trades at a reasonable 14.8X forward earnings multiple and less than 1X price to sales.

ReNew Energy Global RNW
Several alternative energy players are standing out this week with ReNew Energy Global being one to consider after surpassing its fiscal second quarter earnings expectations on Monday. ReNew Energy is a renewable power producer that operates utility-scale wind energy projects and RNW shares look intriguing as the company approaches profitability.
ReNew Energy’s Q2 earnings of $0.11 a share more than doubled estimates of $0.06 a share and soared from an adjusted loss of -$0.03 per share a year ago. More impressive, sales of $345 million easily surpassed estimates of $298.92 million by 15% and climbed 25% from $275 million last year.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
After going public through a special purpose acquisition merger (SPAC) in 2021, ReNew Energy is now expected to turn a profit of $0.01 a share in its current FY24 compared to an adjusted loss of -$0.15 a share in FY23. Fiscal 2025 EPS is forecasted to rise to $0.06 per share as the risk to reward looks favorable considering ReNew Energy’s growth potential with RNW shares trading around $6 at the moment.

Enlight Renewable Energy ENLT
Going public earlier in the year, Enlight Renewable Energy’s stock looks promising as a provider of a renewable energy platform that operates utility-sale renewable energy projects.
Already profitable, Enlight Renewable’s third quarter earnings of $0.13 per share reassuringly surpassed expectations of $0.09 a share despite sales of $58.32 million missing estimates of $65.78 million.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Still, Enlight Renewable’s annual earnings are now forecasted at $0.57 per share and FY24 EPS is expected to jump another 20% to $0.69 a share. It’s also noteworthy that total sales are projected to climb 39% this year and soar another 50% in FY24 to $401.41 million.

Bottom Line
At the moment, Central Garden & Pet, ReNew Energy Global, and Enlight Renewable Energy’s stock are three to watch after impressive earnings beats helped reconfirm their intriguing growth potential.

NVDA,2023-11-24 21:31:01,"""The net margins of the Magnificent 7 are twice the margins of the rest of the index, and consensus expects this gap will persist through 2025.""","Mega-cap tech stocks have driven the bulk of the stock market's gains in 2023, and they'll probably do the same in 2024.
Goldman Sachs said it expects the top seven stocks in the S&P 500 to outperform the bottom 493 stocks next year.
Faster growth rates and reasonable valuations bode well for mega-cap tech stocks, Goldman said.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks have vastly outperformed the broader stock market this year, and Goldman Sachs expects the trend to continue well into 2024.
""Our baseline forecast suggests that in 2024 the mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500,"" Goldman Sachs' David Kostin said in a recent note.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" mega-cap stocks, which refers to Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia, are responsible for 76% of the S&P 500's 2023 gain of nearly 20%.
Nvidia is up more than 200% year-to-date, and even Apple, the world's largest company, saw its stock price surge nearly 50% this year. The seven companies represent a collective $11.5 trillion in market value.
The extreme concentration of the stock market rally this year has kept bearish investors on high alert, but Goldman Sachs isn't concerned and expects the gains to continue. Here's why.
1. The fundamentals are better
The seven mega-cap tech stocks have more attractive fundamentals when compared to the S&P 500's bottom 493 stocks.
They sport faster growth, higher profit margins, cleaner balance sheets, and reasonable valuations on a relative basis.
""Analyst estimates show the mega-cap tech companies growing sales at a CAGR of 11% through 2025 compared with just 3% for the rest of the S&P 500. The net margins of the Magnificent 7 are twice the margins of the rest of the index, and consensus expects this gap will persist through 2025,"" Kostin said.
And while price-to-earnings valuations are elevated for the tech stocks, when accounting for growth, they're actually in line with the rest of the market.
""On an earnings-weighted basis, the Magnificent 7 long-term expected EPS growth is 8 percentage points faster than the median S&P 500 stock (+17% vs. +9%). On a PEG ratio basis, the relative valuations are in line with the 10-year average,"" Kostin said.
2. Mega-cap tech stocks crashed in 2022
The sharp outperformance in the mega-cap tech stocks this year comes after a brutal 2022 in which a number of the stocks were severely punished by investors. From their peak, Meta fell more than 70%, Nvid dropped more than 60%, and Amazon's share price was cut in half in 2022.
So the sharp trend reversal in performance this year was rather ordinary to Kostin.
""The dominance of mega-cap tech in 2023 largely reflected a reversal of meaningful underperformance in 2022,"" Kostin said, adding that the group of tech stocks fell a collective 39% last year.
3. There's no return relationship for top seven S&P 500 stocks
The 30 percentage point outperformance of the seven mega-cap tech stocks this year relative to the bottom 493 stocks of the S&P 500 is the second largest annual difference since 1970, according to Kostin.
But a historical analysis shows there is no relationship between the trailing and forward returns of the top seven stocks relative to the 493 other stocks.
""While the magnitude of outperformance has been striking, there has been no reliable historical relationship between the trailing and forward 12-month outperformance of the largest seven S&P 500 constituents vs. the remainder of the index,"" Kostin said.
For example, strong outperformance of the largest seven stocks in 1999 was followed by a dismal performance in 2000 for those same stocks, while the outperformance in 2020 was followed by another year of outperformance in 2021, Kostin explained.","Here's why the Magnificent 7 tech stocks will continue to outperform the S&P 493 in 2024, according to Goldman Sachs",487.16,477.76001,482.42001,11,2023,24
NVDA,2023-11-24 22:45:01,"Shares of longtime mall fixture Abercrombie & Fitch are up over 210% this year, and the retailer is coming off a massive quarterly jump in sales.","Abercrombie & Fitch stock is up more than 210% in 2023, nearly matching Nvidia's massive gains.
The clothing retailer saw stronger-than-expected sales in the third-quarter, and raised its 2024 outlook.
Abercrombie's adjusted earnings per share of $1.83 beat estimates of $1.15.
Nvidia investors have captured massive, triple-digit stock gains this year on the back of the artificial intelligence boom, but its gains have nearly been matched by a clothing retailer that's been a fixture in American malls for decades.
Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch — an inconic brand that helped shape millennial fashion in the early 2000s — are up more than 210% in 2023, and the company just wrapped up a stellar third quarter.
On Tuesday, Abercrombie raised its net sales outlook for the year ahead to 12%-14%, up from 10%. Its adjusted earnings per share of $1.83 handily beat the consensus estimate of $1.15 a share. Revenue for the quarter came in at $1.06 billion, beating the expected $981 million, per LSEG data.
According to its latest quarterly earnings release, net sales were up 30% year-over-year, and the retailer anticipates further growth in the fourth quarter. Lower freight and raw materials costs, the company said, should help cushion its operating margins moving forward.
The outperformance this year and in the most recent quarter bucks wider trends in the retail space, with numerous chains in all sectors of the consumer economy telling investors that they expect spending to slow into the holiday season. Experts say that there are numerous warning signs flashing that show strong US consumer spending is set to dwindle.
This week Abercrombie rival American Eagle Outfitters saw shares plummet as the clothing chain beat earnings estimates but couldn't impress investors with its guidance.
""Our strong third quarter results, with net sales and operating margin well-exceeding our expectations, speak to the power of our playbook working globally across our brand portfolio,"" Abercrombie chief executive Fran Horowitz said in a statement Tuesday.
Abercrombie stock's remarkable year-to-date gains come as the S&P SmallCap 600 Index has climbed a mere 2% in the same stretch.

NVDA,2023-11-29 22:33:18,"By Rob Lanphier, partner","Through October, the year-to-date performance of U.S. small-mid-cap (SMID) equities, in comparison to large-cap equities, has been abysmal. The Russell 2500 Growth Index[i], for example, is down 1.7% while the Russell 1000 Growth Index[ii] is up 23.2%, a 25-point difference through the first 10 months of 2023. In my 37-year professional career, the calendar has never unfolded like 2023 other than in 1998, the precipice of the Internet bubble.
But the underperformance of smaller caps didn't just start this year. Rather, it has extended for well over a decade and begs two questions: why has it occurred and what could reverse this trend?
While we will address both questions in detail, the bottom line is that investors should consider leaning into this phenomenon today rather than trying to time the market's eventual pivot toward smaller-cap companies.
Market Shift: In Favor of SMID Caps?
While many variables undoubtedly drove the disparity in performance between large and SMID equities year-to-date, the influence of the Magnificent 7 (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and
Tesla) provided a material benefit to larger-cap indices. In the first nine months, the S&P 500 Index[iii] was flat on an equal-weighted basis relative to the 13.1% total return reported. While large-cap concentration risk has been broadly discussed, the negative influence of rising rates on smaller-cap companies may have been overlooked.
Put simply, for the average SMID company, higher rates are a headwind. Smaller companies are more dependent on bank financing. They tend to work with regional banks, and they have a higher percentage of variablenot fixeddebt on their balance sheets; smaller caps also lack the flexibility to offer corporate debt (bonds).
As bank lending tightens, these companies may experience a capital spending squeeze and slower growth. Keeping rates higher for longer for the average smaller-cap company simply extends these headwinds. The regional bank crisis this past spring undoubtedly threw cold water on the average smaller company that is reliant on bank capital.
At the stock level, students know that higher interest rates pressure valuation multiples as you are discounting future cash flows at a higher rate. This typically has a larger impact on growth stocks, where more of the present value is driven by the growth of future cash flows. This was the primary driver of negative equity markets in 2022, although today we believe much of the valuation impact of higher interest rates is already reflected in stock prices. This is not unique to SMID caps; it is true across all market caps. At the same time, the regional bank crisis disproportionately hit smaller stocks.
Whether the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is finished raising rates or not is unclear, but the concept of keeping rates higher for longer is largely assumed by Wall Street through the first half of 2024.
Lastly, as a reminder, no one rings a bell at the bottom. When the market chooses to pivot from large caps is a question only of when, not if in our view. However, it's a fool's errand to think the market can be timed accurately. Further, relying on any one metric to signal this shift would certainly make lifeand the marketseasier, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the cumulative data that has been steadily building. If the market is a leading indicator, as most believe, it would appear prudent to raise asset allocations where one observes the most attractive risk/reward in anticipation of reported fundamentals.
The Case for Supporting SMID Caps Today
Nearly two years ago, we highlighted smaller-cap valuations as looking exceptionally appealing and reiterated those comments as valuation spreads with large caps widened further since January 2023. Today, we are reminded that while the disparity has continued to dramatically widen, no single metricno matter how relevantdictates a market pivot.
As we are often reminded, asset classes can remain undervalued for years. Still, we offer two updated charts through September 30, 2023, below: absolute and relative valuation when measured over the last 37 years. The message is, if nothing else, consistent: Whether you look at the Russell 2000[iv] and Russell 2500[v] Indices from an absolute or relative perspective, their valuations are materially below their long-term median. This is not the case for the Russell Top 200[vi] Index. The same applies to the relative valuation of SMID versus large. Today, this relative metric sits at a generational low.
Market behavior can be radically influenced by economic changes as well as Fed actions, as shown in the chart below, which depicts smaller-cap companies' performance going into a recession, as well as in the subsequent years, for the last six U.S. recessions going back to 1980. In five of the last six recessions, in the 24 months prior to the recession, large caps outperformed small caps. (The one exception was in 1999-2000, where small caps jumped ahead prior to the officially declared recession of 2000-2001).
Yet almost immediately upon entering a recession, smaller caps reversed and outperformed large caps for the next three years, without exception. We are not attempting to forecast anything, but should a recession occur, history makes a powerful case that is difficult to ignore.
Regarding Fed actions, we show in the chart below how small-, mid-, and large-cap companies have behaved, on average, immediately following the first rate cut for the subsequent three, six, and 12 months. Note too that this data covers the period from 1954 to present.
As bottom-up fundamental investors, our primary interest centers around earnings, earnings expectations, and earnings revisions that occur over time. As we observe the cuts in earnings expectations across market caps that Wall Street has made in 2023, what should be immediately apparent is that while small and mid caps have seen earnings expectations trimmed throughout the year, large caps have been remarkably stable.
Whether this suggests that larger-cap revisions have yet to come can be speculated but note in the chart below the flattening of earnings cuts in recent months for both small and mid caps. To the extent that these cuts have moderated, a clear headwind is curtailed. Our observations from our holdings' third-quarter reporting is that our companies have generally reported in-line or better-than-expected results but maintained conservative guidance given the uncertain environment ahead.
Taking this point a step further, small-cap earnings revisions, in total, have turned positive, as shown in the chart below. If one believes that earnings can move higher with earnings cuts stabilizing, we have turned a headwind into a tailwind.
The Impact of Onshoring
One final macro event that has been largely ignored by Wall Street is the secular impact of onshoring on U.S.-centric companies. Let's step back: Globalization has been a life-changing movement for thousands of years, accelerating post-WWII as the U.S. and Allied Navies enforced an open global trade policy. We all know the result: manufacturing costs dropped as did consumer prices, goods selection expanded, and global economic growth ensued.
In more recent years, there has been a globalization backlash as supply chain disruptions destroyed just-in-time expectations, labor cost differentials narrowed with technology and major input disparities (including energy savings) encouraged returning production home. U.S. government tariffs and recent fiscal legislation, including the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Defense Production Act, are further accelerants.
At the time of this writing, it appears that the Panama Canal, which transports 7% of all global seaborne trade, will be limiting activity by more than 50% due to drought. While there will likely be cyclical swings, we believe the secular trend of U.S. onshoring is indisputable and will play out over many years.
What onshoring means for smaller-cap U.S. companies specifically is meaningful. These local companies are in a superior position to address the capital spending that includes not just building the factory itself, but the often materially higher spend associated with the infrastructure necessary to support itthink roads, schools, restaurants, and services broadly. Smaller companies often have the flexibility to adapt and respond to local needs more quickly. This is a distinctive and sustainable tailwind often overlooked by investors.
Our Edge in Small and Mid Caps
Extreme valuation differentials, historic market behavior, and earnings fundamentals should be considered in investors' perception of small and mid caps. The variables likely to create a market shift in favor of smaller caps are building rapidly, and we believe an active manager with SMID-cap expertise is critical.
William Blair's 88-year history is rooted in quality SMID-cap investing. It is who we are and what we do, and we believe we do it well. We aim to focus on what we know has worked well and what we believe will continue to win over time: sustained superior fundamentals combined with a valuation discipline that identifies attractive risk/reward.
While no one can accurately predict when the shift to smaller caps will occur, prudence suggests leaning into this extraordinarily skewed and unsustainable imbalance between U.S. large and small-mid-cap equities.

Japan is rushing to rebuild its once world-leading semiconductor infrastructure and catch up on the development of AI technology. The graphics processing units (GPUs) made by U.S.-based Nvidia dominate the market for AI.
""Demand is very high, but I promised the prime minister we will do our very, very best to prioritise Japan's requirements for GPUs,"" Huang told reporters at Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's official residence in Tokyo.
Huang's visit came less than two weeks after Japan passed an extra budget that included about 2 trillion yen ($13.60 billion) earmarked for chip investment.
Some of the funds are expected to be used to support Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC and chip foundry venture Rapidus, which aims to manufacture cutting-edge chips in Japan's northern island of Hokkaido.
""The semiconductor industry that Japan is now starting to grow and foster will be able to produce GPUs,"" Huang said.
""Countries like Japan are realising that you need to own your own data, build your own AI factories and produce your own AI intelligence,"" he added.

Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker TSMC and many other semiconductor firms, has its own restrictions on what can go to China, which claims the democratically-governed island as its own territory.
Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said some details of the extremely long new U.S. rules needed explanation.
""We think that them (the U.S.) coming to Taiwan, to explain things to companies, getting a face-to-face understanding of the thinking of U.S. enforcement agencies, having on site communication on the details, is something Taiwan needs,"" she told reporters.
Given the concentration of chip making in Taiwan it was ""advantageous"" for Taiwanese companies to hear the details of the new controls from the U.S. officials, Wang said.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the U.S. officials, who it did not name, would visit Taiwan next month and hold events in the chip hubs of Hsinchu and Tainan.
The U.S. Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment outside business hours.

NVDA,2023-12-04 12:12:57,"The chipmaker has been quick to redesign its products to pass the current restrictions, but US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo seems to have had enough.","Nvidia's penchant for redesigning its GPUs to get around US export restrictions has seemingly been directly called out by the US Commerce Secretary, with a warning that when such redesigns are created ""I'm going to control it the very next day.""
Since 2022, US chip sanctions have continued to make life somewhat difficult for manufacturers looking to export their products to certain countries, chief among them on the list being China. However, that hasn't stopped Nvidia from attempting to work its way around the export bans by releasing products that circumvent the current restrictions, introducing slightly redesigned models produced exclusively for the Chinese market.
It's been an entertaining power play, but US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo appears to have had her fill of the one up-manship. According to Fortune (Via Videocardz), she made some particularly pointed comments on the subject during the Reagan National Defence Forum in California on Saturday.
""We cannot let China get these chips, period"" she said. ""We're going to deny them our most cutting edge technology.""
And then more pointedly: ""If you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI, I'm going to control it the very next day""
Given Nvidia GPUs and its associated Tensor cores are particularly efficient at working with AI, it's no surprise the change in language here is becoming more direct and the comments more pointed. Nvidia in particular has been quick to redesign its products to beat the sanctions, including what appears to be a hamstrung RTX 4090 designed to get past the restriction on total processing performance (TTP) and performance density (TD), the two metrics currently used to judge whether a consumer GPU can be exported to restricted markets.

Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.
Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.
Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest.
Of course, it's not just China that chipmakers are currently restricted from exporting to, but it appears clear from these comments that stopping the supply here is the focus for the US Department of Commerce. However, China represents a gigantic market for any chipmaker, and it's no surprise that a game of whack-a-mole would begin between those who make the restrictions and those who seek to make a profit.
It wasn't long ago that it was reported that Chinese companies are buying up US chipmaking equipment to make advanced semiconductors of their own, so it seems that one way or the other China will eventually be able to supply itself with powerful hardware capable of handling heavy AI workloads regardless.
In the meantime, the game continues. The discourse is starting to hot up, and we'll be interested to see what the next moves will be from either side.","US gov fires a warning shot at Nvidia: 'We cannot let China get these chips...

Nvidia Corp. executives and directors last month sold or filed paperwork showing they intend to sell roughly 370,000 shares worth about $180 million, according to data compiled by the Washington Service. If all of the shares were sold, it would be the biggest monthly disposal by dollar value in at least six years.
After more than tripling in 2023, Nvidia shares have turned sluggish. The stock has fallen more than 6% since Nov. 21, when the company gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that exceeded the average analyst estimate by about $2 billion, fueled by heavy demand for artificial intelligence computing chips.
It’s understandable that insiders would want to lock in gains after such a stellar run, of course. However, selling hardly inspires confidence in a future rally. Nvidia insiders haven’t made any stock purchases since 2020, according to the Washington Service data.
“It is somewhat interesting that there has been a lot of sell activity and no buying,” said Shana Sissel, chief executive of Banrion Capital Management, which holds Nvidia shares. “Given how the stock price has done, the opportunity to monetize some of their compensation makes sense.”
A representative for Nvidia said the majority of the sales are based on 10b5-1 plans, in which the price, amount and dates of the sales are set in advance.
Among the four insiders who disclosed sales or intent to sell in November was Mark Stevens, a director at Nvidia since 2008. The former managing partner at venture capital firm Sequoia Capital filed a form 144 on Nov. 24 indicating the planned sale of 300,000 shares and sold 10,280 shares on Nov. 24 and Nov. 27. Stevens has sold hundreds of thousands of shares over the past few years and still has a stake in Nvidia worth about $2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Other sellers include Debora Shoquist, executive vice president of operations, and Dawn Hudson, who joined Nvidia’s board in July.
In the S&P 500, corporate insiders stepped up buying of their own shares in November with the ratio of buyers to sellers poised to hit a six-month high, according to data from the Washington Service.

Cloud and AI-driven spending can fuel the tech sector into a new bull market in 2024, in their view.
""[W]e view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995.""
Wall Street has been fixated on artificial intelligence-related stocks all year, but according to Wedbush, the market is still largely underestimating the transformative potential and huge spending spree that the technology will bring.
In a note Monday, strategists led by Dan Ives forecasted that tech stocks are poised to surge in 2024 as companies ramp up resources dedicated to AI and cloud technology. Spending in those two areas, in Wedbush's view, will outpace budgets within the IT space.
""We believe the new tech bull market has now begun and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 with tech stocks we expect to be up 20%+ over the next year led by Big Tech as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector,"" Ives wrote.
Wedbush likened the impact of AI on business and technology to that of the internet, and the strategists said AI is in its ""1995 moment.""
Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Datadog, and Palantir have already illustrated how AI use cases are increasing across the enterprise and consumer landscape, and things are only ramping up.
The firm's favorite tech names include Apple, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Palantir, Zscaler, CrowdStrike, and MongoDB, according to Monday's note. Meanwhile, as far as consumer tech plays, Wedbush highlighted Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms as names to watch.

The Santa Clara, California-based company will seek to partner with Japanese research organizations, companies and startups to build factories of AI, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said during opening remarks in a meeting with Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura Tuesday. Nvidia will set up an AI research laboratory and invest in local startups and educate the public on using AI, Huang said.
Nvidia’s graphics chips, which process large amounts of data by performing calculations in parallel, have become the leading tool for training AI services. Prices for Nvidia chips have surged as companies and governments fight to develop their own AI prowess. Huang earlier this week met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and promised to do his best to prioritize Japan, according to local news reports.
“We will build a network of AI factories here in Japan, so that Japan can process the data of the society and create intelligence for the society and for the industry,” Huang said.
Tokyo is trying to regain tech leadership by leveraging its expertise in materials science and chipmaking tools and by supplying billions of dollars in subsidies to ramp up domestic production of cutting-edge semiconductors. But it’s largely missed out on the lion’s share of profits related to generative AI so far. Huang said that Japan could build its own AI ecosystem.
“Japan has all of the technical expertise, the industrial capability to create your own artificial intelligence right here in Japan,” Huang told Nishimura, adding that Japan has decades of expertise in megatronics, manufacturing and robotics.
Japan can build its own AI infrastructure, harnessing Japanese data and create its own AI, he said. “There is no reason to export Japan’s data. There is no reason to export Japan’s artificial intelligence.”
Nvidia supplies chips and servers to Japanese companies including SoftBank Corp., NEC Corp. and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., which are racing one another to build Japanese large language models and other Japan-specific AI infrastructure.
“For Japan to develop its own generative AI, we need Nvidia’s GPUs. We cannot do it without collaborating,” Nishimura said. “I’d like to see Japan lead the world in innovation through deepened partnership with Nvidia.”

NVDA,2023-12-06 15:10:33,The president and chief executive of the chipmaker to ChatGPT says the rise of AI is no cause for concern.,"At a time when the ethics of the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is dividing opinion, the founder of the world's leading AI chip maker says he's not concerned.
""I have every confidence that between all of our colleagues around the world, we will invent technologies, philosophies, methodologies, practices, monitors, regulations, design practices, to keep technology safe,"" founder, President and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang told the BBC at a roundtable interview on Wednesday.
His comments come a month after artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI descended into chaos, during which founder Sam Altman was sacked by the board, and then re-instated after an uproar.
During the drama at the company, which operates the large language model ChatGPT, a spotlight was shone on how commercial competition is shaping the development of AI systems and the pace at which the technology is moving.
However, top investor Microsoft denied it was due to a disagreement over safety.
ChatGPT, was in fact, trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.
The demand for its AI chips has pushed Nvidia's share price more than threefold, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
In May the firm joined technology giants Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the elite club of companies with stock market valuations of more than $1 trillion (£822bn).
But the company is not alone in its pursuit of the AI chip businesses - Chinese telecoms firm Huawei has said it intends to make AI an integral part of its strategy, with its CFO Meng Wanzhou saying it wants to provide the world with a ""second option"".
But Mr Huang says he is not phased by such competition, saying it is good for the advancement of the technology.
""It allows us to do our best work and make contributions to society,"" said the chips founder, who is estimated to have a net worth of $41.6bn, according to Forbes.
Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower
The US is beating China in the battle for chips
The chip designer dominates more than 90% of China's $7bn (£8.8bn) AI chip market, and Mr Huang acknowledged that historically around 20% of its revenue came from China.
But in its November earnings report, Nvidia warned that it expects a fall in sales towards the end of the year because of US export restrictions aimed at curbing China's advancement in the field.
The US said the measures were designed to prevent China from receiving cutting-edge technologies that it could use to strengthen its military, especially in the field of AI.
Nvidia is working closely with the US government, Mr Huang said, to make sure chips for the Chinese market are fully compliant with the current rules.
What does the future hold?
Despite relations between China and the US deteriorating in recent years, the Asia-Pacific region is central to Nvidia's supply chain.
Its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has 35,000 parts, according to Mr Huang, with chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, memory chips from South Korea, packaging technology from Japan and technologies that power the chips from the United States.
""This is the most sophisticated computer in the world. It's kind of a technology miracle.""
There is a recognition that AI is no longer just an opportunity, but that it is strategically vital, Mr Huang added, revealing that Nvidia is working with the Singapore government on a large language model called Sealion, as well as the country's overall AI strategy - and planned to make big investments there.
Mr Huang added that Singapore is a growing market for his company because of the 1,100 AI start-ups based there and its role as a data centre hub for the region, but also because it is home to venture capitalists that fund the AI ecosystem.
""Once we have that language, once we have that foundation, the Singapore foundation, then the rest of the industries, the rest of society, the rest of competition, can then build upon that,"" he said.
""The first wave was the American internet companies. The second wave are now the world's countries. Each one of the countries wants to build its own foundation to support its start-ups, its own companies, its own industries. And so now now we're seeing globally, the need to replicate what happened in the United States.""",Nvidia boss Jensen Huang confident about AI safety,465.66,455.03,465.95999,12,2023,6

Its shares closed 2% higher, extending its gains for 2023 to 49%.
The tech giant is on track to end the year as the world’s most-valuable company for the fifth time in a row.
Apple passed the $3 trillion threshold once again Tuesday, with the Cupertino, CA-based tech giant on course to finish the year as the world's most-valuable company for the fifth time in a row.
Shares had climbed 2% by the end of the trading session, which boosted Apple's total market capitalization to $3.01 trillion, according to data from Refinitiv.
It's the first time since August that the company has been worth more than $3 trillion, after a so-so couple of months where concerns about its reliance on sales in China weighed on shares. Apple's earnings report for the July-September quarter showed its revenue from the Asian nation dropped 2.5%, amid signs that the world's second-largest economy is faltering with growth stagnating and property prices tumbling.
After Tuesday, Apple is up 49% in 2023. That's added nearly $1 trillion to its total market cap, by Business Insider's calculations.
It's comfortably outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 index – but lagging five of the other ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks, with Nvidia, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft all racking up larger gains year-to-date.
Still, as long as Apple can hold off Microsoft — worth $2.74 trillion as of Tuesday's close — 2023 will see it extend a run of dominance that started in 2012.

At an event Wednesday held in San Jose, California, Su unveiled a long-anticipated lineup called the MI300, taking aim at an industry dominated by Nvidia Corp. That forecast is more than twice as high as the one AMD gave in August, showing how rapidly expectations are changing for artificial intelligence hardware.
The launch is one of the most important in AMD’s 50-year history, setting up a showdown with Nvidia in the red-hot market for AI accelerators. Such chips help develop AI models by bombarding them with data, a task they handle more adeptly than traditional computer processors.
AMD is showing increasing confidence that the MI300 lineup can win over some of the biggest names in technology, potentially diverting billions in spending toward the company. Companies using the processors will include Microsoft Corp., AMD said.
The new chip has more than 150 billion transistors and 2.4 times as much memory as Nvidia’s H100, the current market leader. It also has 1.6 as much memory bandwidth, further boosting performance, AMD said.
Su said that the new chip is equal to Nvidia’s H100 in its ability to train AI software and much better at inference — the process of running that software — once it’s ready for real-world use.
Nvidia shares dipped 1.3% to $459.61 in New York on Wednesday, while AMD’s stock was little changed.

Today, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google announced it took its next AI leap with the launch of an AI model trained to behave in human-like ways.
Google Debuted Its Latest Generative AI Offering
Today, Google debuted Gemini, its generative AI model that promises to challenge the Microsoft-backed Open AI’s GPT-4. With its natively multimodal model that is capable of working with text, audio, video, images, and code, Google aims to differentiate Gemini with the fact that it has been designed to take all those different mediums into account from the very beginning as opposed to stringing all these separate models together into one. In other words, Google claims its generative-AI model can better understand multimodal data and therefore, produce better results compared to others. Gemini is undoubtedly Google’s biggest attempt to date to challenge Open AI and its backer-Microsoft. By the looks of it, Gemini promises to have what it takes for Google to stop playing catch up.
Amazon Is Determined To Fight Microsoft For AI Dominance
During its annual event that has been designed to showcase important novelties at Amazon Web Services, Amazon was all about generative AI. Among the most important news are the new Q chatbot, an upgraded AI chip, the Trainium2, as well as the deepening of the partnership with the chipmaking leader, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although it still didn’t catch up with Microsoft and Google on the AI front, Amazon is coming and so is its Q chatbot designed for enterprises. Amazon designed Q as a general assistant that drafts emails, summarizes reports, plans workshops and comes up with business ideas. Amazon aims to differentiate its chatbot based on the fact it has been trained on 17 years of AWS data.
Amazon showcased an example of Q turning information from a corporate blog into social media post that even included hashtags, but all in all, the service is similar to what Microsoft and Google are also offering with their generative AI products. But Q will certainly put Amazon on par with Microsoft and Google.
Moreover, with its new chip Trainium2 chips that will offer training four times faster than the first-generation Trainium, while being two times as energy efficient, AI developer Anthropic that Amazon backed, who is creator of the Claude chatbot, committed to develop future foundation models on these improved chips. All in all, Amazon will be entering 2024 ready to battle Microsoft and Google for generative AI market dominance.

Huang, speaking at a Hanoi semiconductor and artificial intelligence conference hosted by a Vietnam ministry Monday, said his company will open a design center, the news website VnExpress reported, without giving details about the facility’s technology.
Nvidia has already invested about $250 million in Vietnam, the government’s news website reported on Sunday, citing information from a meeting between Huang and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.
Huang’s visit to Hanoi comes as the Vietnamese government looks for closer diplomatic and economic ties with the US and help in developing the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.
Vietnam Sees Closer US Economic Ties Post-Diplomatic Upgrade
The US State Department in September announced a partnership with Vietnam under the Chips Act, which provides $500 million for incentives over five years and aims to ensure semiconductor supply chain security. US Semiconductor Industry Association President John Neuffer and representatives of American companies visited with PM Chinh earlier this month.
Nvidia is willing to work with Vietnam to improve the nation’s AI infrastructure and workforce, VietnamPlus reported, citing the CEO. Vietnam has many computer scientists and is a global leader in software exports, Huang said, according to VnExpress. It could create a million AI engineers, he said.
Intel Corp. operates a chip assembly and test manufacturing facility in Ho Chi Minh City. Arizona-based Amkor Technology Inc. is building a $1.6 billion factory in northern Bac Ninh province, while Synopsis Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are establishing semiconductor design centers in Vietnam.

The chart of the day
What we're watching
What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
AI’s unprecedented disruption is just getting started — and so is its investment opportunity.
Those were the dominant themes at the Barclays Global Technology conference last week in San Francisco. The summit brought together CEOs of software and cybersecurity firms, along with venture capitalists and top industry analysts.
Unwavering excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has pushed the ""Magnificent Seven""— Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) — to sweltering valuations. Next year, the AI craze will likely expand beyond mega-cap names, trickling down to smaller tech plays.
“The AI momentum will carry into 2024 and beyond,” Kristin Roth DeClark, Barclays global head of technology investment banking, told me at the event. “It's a massive movement happening in technology that we haven't seen since the internet.”
While Nvidia’s GPUs were all the rage this year, other hardware makers are set to benefit from the growth of cloud computing.
“Arista Networks (ANET) is the leading AI play. They make switches and routers — the networking element of these data centers — and normally that's 10% or so of the spend in AI data centers,” said Barclays senior tech analyst Tim Long.
Juniper Networks (JNPR) — which also makes networking gear — has started to see the benefits of AI, as it integrates features like virtual assistants and advanced insights to help corporations more easily manage its IT network.
“Our AI-driven enterprise business has been performing phenomenally well,” said Juniper CEO Rami Rahim. “This is proof that AI is not just in its hype cycle, it's proof that AI is actually delivering real results for our end customers.”
Watch out for opportunities in cybersecurity as well. Generative AI poses a risk of increasingly sophisticated attacks, but also a chance for companies to advance their own technologies. Cato Networks, for example, is using AI to improve its threat detection, per CEO Shlomo Kramer.
A key for software companies in 2024 will be to incorporate AI features into product offerings, a move that will expand value for customers. Developer platform GitLab (GTLB) has added a suite of 14 AI capabilities, including a feature that provides suggestions to help analyze code. The company reported a 32% rise in revenue in its Q3 earnings.
“AI is revolutionizing the software development world,” GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij told me. “It is a tailwind and it makes our software way more useful.”
While the mega-cap companies raced to build and train AI models in 2023, the theme for 2024 will be how businesses across the spectrum are monetizing new AI features.
“Before, everybody was looking for growth, but now people are looking for real, profitable businesses,"" said Lux Capital managing partner Bilal Zuberi. ""It’s becoming more metrics and operations driven.”

NVDA,2023-12-11 19:31:18,This pending development could be a boon to Intel investors,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) rallied out of the gate on Monday morning, adding as much as 4.3%. As of 1:32 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 4.2%.
The catalyst that sent the semiconductor giant higher was comments made by Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress.
A collaboration?
It's been a banner year for Nvidia, with the hastening adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) causing a run on the graphics processing units (GPUs) used for it. As a result, demand has far outstripped supply.
By some accounts, the shortage of these graphics cards could last for the coming 12 to 18 months, according to a report by technology news site Tom's Hardware.
While the vast majority of these processors are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (aka TSM), Nvidia is open to working with another foundry to ease the backlog -- namely Intel.
During last week's UBS Global Technology Conference, Kress was asked if Nvidia would consider using Intel as a foundry partner to produce its state-of-the-art AI chips. The finance chief said the company would ""love"" to. After commenting on existing foundry partnerships with TSM and Samsung, Kress said: ""Would we love a third one? Sure. We would love a third one ... [there's] nothing that stops us from potentially adding another foundry.""
We've heard this story before
This isn't the first time Nvidia has alluded to its willingness to share some of its chip manufacturing with Intel. Last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company had plans to diversify the production of its AI processors. He went on to say that Nvidia had reviewed Intel's test chip, and the ""results look good.""
Intel is a mixed bag at this point, though its foundry business is something of a high point. There are reasons to buy and to sell, and investors should do more homework to decide if the stock is right for their situation.

NASHUA, New Hampshire (Reuters) - The Biden administration is in discussions with Nvidia Corp about permissible sales of artificial intelligence chips to China but emphasized that it cannot sell its most advanced semiconductors to Chinese firms.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, speaking in an interview with Reuters on Monday, said Nvidia ""can, will and should sell AI chips to China because most AI chips will be for commercial applications.""
She added: ""What we cannot allow them to ship is the most sophisticated, highest processing power AI chips, which would enable China to train their frontier models.""
Raimondo said she spoke a week ago to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and he was ""crystal clear. We don't want to break the rules. Tell us the rules, we'll work with you.""
Raimondo said the department was working with Nvidia. ""They want to do the right thing. Obviously they want to sell as many chips as possible.""
Nvidia declined to comment. Last week, Huang said the company was working closely with the U.S. government to ensure new chips for the Chinese market were compliant with export curbs.
The California-based artificial intelligence chip designer has commanded more than 90% share of China's $7 billion AI chip market, but analysts have said new U.S. curbs on chip exports are likely to create opportunities for Chinese rivals to make inroads.
Reuters last month reported Nvidia had told customers in China it was delaying the launch of a new China-focused AI chip until the first quarter of next year.
""Our plan now is to continue to work with the government to come up with a new set of products that comply with the new regulations that have certain limits.""
Nvidia warned during its November earnings that it expects a steep drop in fourth-quarter sales in China in the wake of the new U.S. rules.

While Nvidia reported its latest reported quarter revenue tripled with its net income income rising to $9.24 billion, its rivals are pulling out the big guns in their effort to catch up. This week, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) unveiled new AI chips that promise to challenge its dominance, while also lifting its market value forecast for AI chips to $400 billion by 2027. Then there’s the e-commerce and cloud giant, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) that recently unveiled next-generation AWS-designed chips with which it will be challenging the early-start advantage in generative AI that Microsoft enjoys.
AMD Is Aiming High With Its Two New Chips
As it launched a new generation of AI chips on Wednesday, AMD also provided an estimate of a $45 billion addressable market for its own data center artificial intelligence processors this year, rising from its June estimate of $30 billion. The new AI data center chips are from the MI300 lineup, with one being designed for generative AI applications and the second for supercomputers. The MI300 series is positioned to challenge Nvidia’s flagship AI processors.
Amazon Is Going After Microsoft With New AI Chip And Deepened Nvidia Partnership
During its AWS re:Invent event, Amazon announced its new Trainium2 artificial intelligence chip and the general-purpose Graviton4 processors that consume less energy compared to chips from AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) while also promising a 30% performance improvement from its existing Graviton3 while being twice as energy efficient.
But Amazon is going for a dual approach as it aims to sell both Amazon-branded products as well as from others, such as the in-demand GPUs from Nvidia. Amazon is trying to challenge Microsoft by making AWS stand out as a cloud provider with a variety of cost-effective options. By deepening its partnership with Nvidia, Amazon will also be offering access to its next-generation H200 Tensor Core GPUs. But Microsoft also opted for a similar approach as along with unveiling its inaugural AI chip, the Maia 100, it also revealed that through Azure cloud, it will be offering access to Nvidia’s H200 GPUs. The new GPU from Nvidia is an upgrade from the H100 which the Microsoft-backed Open AI used to train its most advanced large language model, GPT-4.
By the looks of it, it seems that AMD has finally come up with a strategy to catch up to Nvidia, and Amazon’s new cloud chip could be the answer to its intense rivalry with Microsoft.

“We look at every spec of every new chip, obviously to make sure it doesn’t violate the export controls,” she said in an interview Monday with Bloomberg News during a visit to Nashua, New Hampshire.
“We talk to Nvidia regularly, and I should say they’re a good partner,” she added. “We have a close working relationship with them. They share information.”
Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, is in the process of developing China-specific chips after the US tightened export controls to block the export of semiconductors the company had earlier designed for China. The new processors abide by the stricter China guidelines that Commerce announced earlier this fall, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang told reporters in Singapore last week.
In response to Raimondo’s latest remarks, Nvidia said it was working with the US government following its clear rules and looking to “offer compliant data center solutions to customers worldwide.”
Raimondo warned companies this month that the US can and will further tighten controls to capture new technologies that could give Beijing an edge. “If you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI, I’m going to control it the very next day,” she said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California.
The Commerce Department declined to comment on whether it plans to restrict Nvidia’s new chips but reiterated that it will continually update rules to respond to an evolving threat.

Huang was on a trip to Southeast Asia, where Nvidia inked a partnership in Malaysia.
Nvidia's plans signal a shift in high-tech supply chain development amid US-China tensions.
Chipmaker Nvidia is looking to Southeast Asia for expansion plans, signaling a shift in global advanced tech supply chains.
In his trip to Vietnam, Nvidia CEO and president Jensen Huang reportedly declared the Southeast Asian country the company's second home.
""This trip will definitely open up future trips. I will return to Vietnam, to Nvidia's second homeland,"" Huang said on Monday, as reported by VietNamNet, a state-affiliated media outlet.
Nvidia has already invested $250 million in Vietnam and is planning to expand partnerships with the country's top tech companies.
Huang was in Vietnam as part of his visit to Southeast Asia, which also included stops in Malaysia and Singapore.
He told reporters at a media roundtable in Malaysia last week that he has ""great confidence that Southeast Asia is going to be a very important technology hub.""
""It's already quite excellent at packaging and assembly and battery manufacturing. It's already very good at many aspects of the technology supply chain,"" he added.
Nvidia is partnering with Malaysia's YTL Power International to develop AI infrastructure, the utility company announced Friday.
Nvidia was also discussing potential AI investment in Singapore.
Nvidia's high-profile trip to Southeast Asia came amid heightened tensions between the US and China related to issues including rivalry over semiconductor chips.
To de-risk, many global companies are shifting parts of their supply chain from China — the world's factory floor for the past four decades — to other locations. Southeast Asia is set to benefit from this trend.
Nvidia is having a blowout year after OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot propelled AI technology into the mainstream.
The Santa Clara-based chipmaker beat expectations in the third quarter, as revenue soared 206% to $18.1 billion. The company's stock has tripled this year, boosting its market value beyond $1 trillion.
Company cofounder Huang, who owns a 3.5% stake in the company, has also seen his fortune triple to $42.2 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

NVDA,2023-12-12 11:15:00,"""Just 'cause it's obvious, doesn't mean it's wrong."" -- Matthew Ramsay","While I generally take Wall Street's never-ending stream of upgrades and downgrades with a grain of salt, I think this one makes a compelling argument.
TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay announced the firm's ""Best Idea"" for 2024 and it should come as no surprise that it was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The firm issued an outperform (buy) rating on the shares and a $700 price target, which represents potential gains of 50% upside compared to Monday's closing price -- even after a blistering rise of 219% so far this year, fueled by soaring adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).
Investors would be forgiven for asking, ""Does Nvidia really have 50% potential upside from here?""
To be fair, I think the analyst is being a bit too conservative. Here's why:
The catalyst that drove Nvidia stock higher this year was back-to-back quarters of triple-digit, year-over-year growth.The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and accompanying software provide the computational horsepower needed for AI applications.
That's not to say there isn't competition, but as Ramsay notes, the market is ""more than sufficiently large"" to accommodate multiple competitors. I think he's onto something.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs estimate the market opportunity at $6 trillion and $7 trillion, respectively, by 2030. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes the AI software opportunity alone tops out at $14 trillion by 2030. Whatever the case, the market is big enough to handle multiple players.
Furthermore, Nvidia has successfully adapted the humble GPU to a wide variety of computationally demanding tasks, including machine learning (a branch of AI) and data centers, among others. Its processors are the gold standard for both of these applications, and some estimates place Nvidia's market share as high as 95% in the data center market and 95% in the machine learning market. Even if Nvidia only captures a fraction of the generative AI market, the rewards for the company and its investors could be substantial.
Let's not forget the gaming market, which has just shown the first green shoots of growth after a historic downturn.
CEO Jensen Huang has a long history of skating to where the puck will be and positioning Nvidia for the next big thing. Given his track record and the multiple opportunities, I think Nvidia could fly much higher than Wall Street believes.

NVDA,2023-12-12 11:18:00,Warren Buffett's investment company might be set to join the stock market's most exclusive club.,"Warren Buffett was born in 1930 at the outset of the Great Depression. He purchased his first stock at age 11, and by 1965, he was operating his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). He still runs the company today.
Berkshire holds an incredible portfolio of public and private companies, and it has successfully navigated every post-Depression crisis to significantly outperform the benchmark S&P 500 over the last 58 years.
Berkshire's largest holding today is Apple, which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. Since then, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (parent company of Google), and Nvidia have all amassed trillion-dollar valuations of their own.
Thanks to Buffett's leadership, Berkshire is now valued at $772 billion, and its stellar track record suggests it could soon become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club. Here's why it could become a $1 trillion company as soon as 2024.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
Buffett's recipe for success
Buffett is a value investor. He looks for profitable companies with consistent growth and strong management teams, and he especially likes those returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
He waits patiently to grab those opportunities at a reasonable price. You won't find him chasing the latest stock market trends; in fact, he's often deploying billions of dollars when most other investors are selling.
However, Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He buys stocks with the intention of holding for decades, which allows the effects of compounding to build his wealth for him. The companies he owns grow larger over time, and so do the dividends.
For example, Berkshire invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994, acquiring 400 million shares, which it still owns today. Coca-Cola paid Berkshire a dividend of $75 million in 1994 -- in 2022, that dividend payment had swelled to $704 million! Not to mention the incredible capital growth; Berkshire's 400 million Coca-Cola shares are now worth $23.6 billion.
From the brink of failure to a financial juggernaut
Berkshire Hathaway was founded as a textiles company in 1929, and Buffett acquired a controlling stake in 1965 when it was going through a rough patch. He quickly realized Berkshire's core business was no longer viable, so he turned it into a holding company for his various investments.
Today, it owns 51 different publicly traded stocks and securities worth a combined $365 billion, and Coca-Cola is just one of many success stories. The following are equally noteworthy:
American Express: Berkshire owns a 20% stake in the credit card giant, valued at $25.5 billion. But it all started with a $1.3 billion investment in the lead up to 1995, and today, the firm collects $304 million in dividends (and growing) every year.
Apple: Berkshire has invested around $35 billion in Apple stock since 2016 -- its largest ever bet. It has paid off handsomely because the stake is currently valued at more than $179 billion, accounting for almost half of the investment company's public portfolio.
Plus, Berkshire wholly owns several successful private businesses like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO.
Berkshire has a long track record of crushing the market
Buffett has presided over substantial returns for investors. Between the time he acquired a controlling stake in Berkshire in 1965 and the end of 2022, the company's stock had delivered a mind-blowing gain of 3,787,464%.
That translates to a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is twice the return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. That would've been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $100 into more than $3.7 million. The incredible gain comes on the back of a stellar operating performance by Buffett and his team.
Berkshire generated just $49 million in revenue in 1965, and by 2022, that had grown to a whopping $302 billion. Over $157 billion came from sales and services across its various businesses, with an additional $74 billion coming from insurance premiums and $52 billion coming from its railroad, utilities, and energy interests. The company is on track to increase that figure by 19% in 2023, to $360 billion.
Berkshire has delivered positive growth and strong stock returns during 11 different presidencies without straying from Buffett's fundamental strategy. With a presidential election coming up in 2024, that's a great reminder for everyday investors to stay the course, no matter which candidate wins.
Berkshire could join the $1 trillion club in 2024
As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire Hathaway is valued at $772 billion. Therefore, its stock needs to gain about 30% to propel the company into the $1 trillion club. Based on its average annual return of 19.8% since 1965, it doesn't appear likely to get there in 2024.
However, there's a good possibility Berkshire could outperform next year. History suggests 2024 will almost certainly bring more positive returns for the S&P 500, and Apple stock (Berkshire's largest holding) is entering the year near its best-ever level. Plus, some of Berkshire's top income producing stocks like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Bank of America are currently paying record dividends.
The broader macroeconomic environment will likely be more favorable in 2024, too. According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates five times throughout the year. That will be great for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses, and also its transport and logistics segments as lower rates should drive more economic growth.
Finally, as my Motley Fool colleague Sean Williams points out, Berkshire is buying back its own stock hand over fist. It has completed a whopping $72 billion worth of share repurchases during the past five years, so Buffett himself is clearly very bullish on its prospects.
Nevertheless, even if Berkshire doesn't make it into the $1 trillion club in 2024, it's only a matter of time.

NVDA,2023-12-12 21:42:02,Nvidia stock has tripled this year as investors bet AI will fuel sales of graphics chips. They'll cheer Ellison's comment about Musk's strong demand.,"Nvidia stock has tripled this year as investors bet the AI boom will fuel demand for graphics chips.
Oracle's Larry Ellison said Elon Musk's xAI wanted more Nvidia chips than it could offer last quarter.
Oracle is spending heavily on scaling up to meet intense demand from clients like Musk.
Nvidia stock has more than tripled this year as investors bet the graphics-chip specialist will power the artificial-intelligence revolution. Elon Musk is among those who can't get enough of its semiconductors, Oracle's Larry Ellison said on Monday.
Musk has opted to use Oracle's servers to run his xAI company's recently launched chatbot, Grok. The cloud-infrastructure giant managed to provide enough Nvidia chips to power the first version of Grok, but fell short of Musk's demands, Ellison said during Oracle's latest earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense/Sentieo.
""Boy, did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them,"" Oracle's billionaire cofounder and tech chief said. ""We gave them quite a few but they wanted more, and we are in the process of getting them more.""
""They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more as there's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model,"" Ellison, one of Tesla's biggest shareholders, continued. ""And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter, and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter.""
Ellison gave the example of xAI after a Wall Street analyst questioned Oracle's plans to build 100 new cloud data centers, up from around 66 today. Ellison noted that Microsoft alone has ordered 20 data centers to support its Azure cloud-computing platform, and Oracle wants to build many others to meet demand from its direct customers.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz struck a similar tone, saying that the company held back last quarter to make sure it could provide larger-scale services going forward. There was ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" waiting to be scooped up, she said, but Oracle left it on the table so it could focus on building capacity ""because we need more and we need it bigger.""
Musk has been loading up on Nvidia chips for his companies for a while now. Business Insider's Kali Hays reported in April that he had purchased 10,000 graphics processors for xAI. The Tesla CEO also said on an earnings call in July that the EV maker was buying as many as it could.
""We're using a lot of Nvidia hardware,"" he said. ""We'll actually take it as fast as they'll deliver it to us. Frankly, if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so many customers.""
Ellison's latest comment about Musk and xAI suggests demand for graphics chips remains intense, which is welcome news for Nvidia investors.","Elon Musk wanted way more Nvidia chips for his Grok chatbot than Oracle could provide, Larry Ellison says",466.26999,476.57001,480.88,12,2023,12

NVDA,2023-12-13 10:50:00,Both of these two AI stocks have been sizzling hot in 2023.,"Which huge artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker has the most momentum right now? It's not Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Sure, Nvidia's shares have more than tripled in 2023. Over the last three months, though, the stock is only up by the low-single digits.
Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has more than doubled this year. And its stock has especially been on fire recently, jumping close to 30% over the last three months.
Investors have an interesting choice in picking between these two stocks. Here are two reasons why AMD is a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia -- and two reasons why it isn't.
Two reasons why AMD is better than Nvidia
1. Customers looking for an alternative
I'd argue that the top reason why AMD could be a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia right now is that customers are looking for an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This presents a tremendous opportunity for AMD to step up to the plate.
We've already seen this happen in recent days. Both Meta Platforms and Microsoft plan to use AMD's new Instinct MI300X AI chip. This appears to be a clear sign that tech giants are trying not to rely exclusively on Nvidia.
The bottom line is that if AMD offers a viable cost-effective alternative to Nvidia, the company could have greater growth prospects than Nvidia does. And that could enable its stock to continue outperforming Nvidia like it's done over the last three months.
2. Diversification if the AI chip market gets bumpy
With Nvidia, you pretty much get GPUs and nothing but GPUs. At least, that's been the story so far for the company. Reuters reported in October that Nvidia has started designing central processing units (CPUs) using Arm's technology. We have yet to see the fruit of these reported efforts, though.
For now, Nvidia is more dependent on the AI chip market than AMD is. That's not a bad thing when the AI market is booming as it has been this year. However, there's something to be said in favor of the diversification that AMD offers. The company makes more types of chips that are used for a broader range of purposes. Should the AI market experience some bumps in the road, AMD could weather the volatility better than Nvidia.
Two reasons why AMD isn't better than Nvidia
1. Nvidia's dominant market share
Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for training and powering AI applications. Unsurprisingly, the company dominates the AI chip market. Importantly, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. It is still investing heavily in research and development. It continues to roll out more powerful AI chips.
AMD probably won't dethrone Nvidia anytime soon. And unless it launches AI chips that are clearly superior to Nvidia's GPUs, any market share gains made by AMD likely won't hamper Nvidia's growth.
2. Nvidia is more attractively valued than AMD
Oftentimes, the up-and-coming rival is more of a bargain than the 800-pound gorilla in the industry. That isn't the case here. Nvidia is actually more attractively valued than AMD.
AMD stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 36. Nvidia's shares trade at a much lower 23.6 times forward earnings.
The picture looks even better when we factor projected growth into the equation. AMD's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.9 compared to Nvidia's seemingly dirt cheap 0.47.
The easy solution for investors
Both AMD and Nvidia should also deliver strong growth as the demand for AI soars. The good news is that investors don't have to pick which company will be the biggest winner. Investors have an easy solution: Buy both stocks.
I think that AMD and Nvidia could experience more choppiness over the next few years. It's unrealistic to expect either stock to continue doubling or tripling every 12 months. For long-term investors, though, both stocks provide an opportunity to profit from the AI boom over the next decade and beyond.

NVDA,2023-12-13 11:45:00,You don't have to buy individual stocks to make money.,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have produced magnificent returns over the years. The seven companies focused on technology megatrends -- Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla -- have absolutely obliterated the S&P 500:
Data source: Ycharts.
The tech trends driving their market-crushing returns (e.g., artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce, and electric vehicles) still have long growth runways ahead. That could give the Magnificent Seven the power to continue outperforming. However, instead of buying all seven stocks, investors could consider taking an even more passive approach by investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a high concentration of those stocks. The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) stands out for its outsized exposure to the Magnificent Seven.
What is the Invesco QQQ Trust?
The Invesco QQQ launched more than two decades ago. It tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, an index of the 100 largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The Invesco QQQ has grown into one of the largest ETFs by assets under management (AUM). It currently holds over $220 billion of client assets, making it one of the five largest ETFs by AUM in the world. It's the second-most traded ETF in the U.S. by average trading volume, showcasing its popularity among investors.
The ETF has also been a top performer over the years. It has delivered an average annualized total return of 17% over the last decade, compared to a nearly 10% average annual total return for the S&P 500. This ETF would have grown a $10,000 investment made a decade ago into nearly $50,000 today. For comparison, the same investment in an S&P 500 index would have grown to only roughly $30,000.
Driving that outperformance is the underlying growth of the companies in the index. That group has grown much faster than other benchmarks over the past 10 years:
10-year compound annual growth rates. Data source: Invesco.
Concentration has played a key role in the index's outsized growth. It holds 100 companies (as opposed to 500 or 1,000) heavily weighted toward faster-growing stock market sectors (technology made up 57% of its holdings). That concentration on companies benefiting from major growth trends has helped power faster financial growth and higher shareholder returns.
A magnificent way to play the Magnificent Seven
The Invesco QQQ Trust is in an excellent position to continue outperforming because it concentrates on companies with outsized growth prospects. It all starts at the top. The fund's top holdings are the Magnificent Seven stocks:
Apple: 10.8% of the fund's holdings.
Microsoft: 9.5%
Amazon: 5.3%.
Nvidia: 4.3%
Meta Platforms: 3.8%.
Tesla: 3.2%.
Alphabet: 3.1% (class A shares) and 3.1% (class C shares)
Overall, those seven companies comprise 43% of the fund's holdings, with the other 93 stocks making up the remaining 57%. That's almost double their weighting in the S&P 500 (and related S&P 500-focused ETFs). Given their outsized weighting in the index, these companies are helping drive higher returns relative to the S&P 500.
The group has outperformed the market this year. According to data from Goldman Sachs, they had gained an average of 71% through mid-November compared to a 6% average gain for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index. If it weren't for the Magnificent Seven's outsized gains and large allocation, the index wouldn't have rallied 19% this year.
Goldman Sachs expects the Magnificent Seven to have another strong year in 2024, predicting they will again outperform the S&P 500. An analyst at the investment bank wrote that ""The seven stocks have faster expected sales growth, higher margins, a greater reinvestment ratio, and stronger balance sheets than the other 493 stocks and trade at a relative valuation in line with recent averages after accounting for expected growth."" Given the Nasdaq-00's higher weighting to this group, the Invesco QQQ is an excellent way to play their potential continued outperformance.
Concentrated at the top
The Invesco QQQ has been a great ETF investment over the years. It has delivered outsize returns for its investors because it concentrates on owning some of the fastest-growing companies benefiting from tech megatrends. That makes this ETF a great way to passively invest in the Magnificent Seven.

NVDA,2023-12-13 12:04:00,These companies have significant potential in AI and make attractive ways to back the high-growth industry.,"Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks surged this year as platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT led many to rethink what is currently possible with the technology. AI has the potential to improve countless industries, including cloud computing, productivity software, e-commerce, autonomous driving, healthcare, and education.
So, it's not surprising that the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% until at least 2030 (per Grand View Research). The sector is developing rapidly, and it could be a smart move to add an AI stock to your portfolio now before it's too late.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are two attractive options, with one profiting from an uptick in AI chip demand and the other gearing up to launch a highly anticipated large language model in 2024.
So, let's assess whether Nvidia or Alphabet is the better stock to invest in AI.
Nvidia
Nvidia's stock has soared 215% this year, rallying investors as its chips have become the preferred hardware for AI developers everywhere. The company has snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), attaining dominance that will likely be challenging for its competitors to overcome.
The tech giant has massive potential in AI and is already seeing big gains from the industry. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, Nvidia posted revenue growth of 206% year over year, with operating income up more than 1,600%. Boosted earnings came alongside a 279% increase in data center revenue thanks to a spike in AI GPU sales.
Additionally, Nvidia's position in AI will likely bolster its gaming division over the long term, with the company able to offer highly powerful chips for consumers and businesses.
Macroeconomic headwinds have burdened the gaming industry over the last two years, triggering reductions in spending on tech. However, Nvidia's latest quarter saw its gaming segment post revenue growth of 81% year over year, signaling a probable end to recent market declines.
Nvidia could be a reliable way to invest in AI as it's one of the few companies already seeing significant growth from the sector and is likely to continue posting impressive earnings in 2024.
Alphabet
Cloud competitors Microsoft and Amazon have slightly overshadowed Alphabet in AI this year. However, the company has heavily invested in the technology and could play a crucial role in developing the market over the long term.
As the home of potent brands like Google, YouTube, and Android, Alphabet has countless ways to monetize its venture into AI. Its Google Cloud division boasts the third-largest market share in cloud computing and is well equipped to take advantage of increased demand for AI cloud services.
In fact, Alphabet revealed in August that 70% of AI start-ups worth more than $1 billion are currently Google Cloud clients, including Anthropic, Character.ai, and Cohere.
Moreover, Alphabet's dominance in digital advertising strengthens its prospects in AI. Platforms such as Google Search and YouTube attract billions of users daily, presenting numerous advertising opportunities. With the help of AI, the company can offer more targeted ads and introduce new features to its services that could expand its user base.
In Q3, Alphabet posted a revenue rise of 11% year over year, beating analysts' forecasts by $980 million. The growth was primarily owed to increased sales in its Google Search and YouTube ad segments, which rose 11% and 12%.
The company's earnings show Alphabet is on a promising growth trajectory. Meanwhile, plans to launch a new large language model called Gemini in 2024 could expand its position in AI.
Is Nvidia or Alphabet the better artificial intelligence (AI) stock?
Alphabet and Nvidia operate in two different areas of AI, with one excelling in hardware and the other with significant potential in the software side of the market. These companies likely have much to offer investors over the long term as demand for AI products continues to rise.
However, Alphabet is a slightly more compelling investment option as it could be the cheapest stock in AI right now.
The chart above compares the price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios of some of the most prominent names in AI. These are helpful metrics to determine the value of a stock, and Alphabet comes out on top on both fronts.
Alphabet's lower figures make it a bargain compared to its peers and especially compared to Nvidia, with its stock the better buy right now.

Two chip stocks that look like great buys now and are critical to the chip supply chain are Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). With each stock trading an attractive valuation and plenty of tailwinds on the horizon, these two could be portfolio-changing investments.
China is a risk for both companies
Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML are not competitors. Instead, ASML supplies its EUV (extreme ultraviolet) and DUV (deep ultraviolet) lithography machines to Taiwan Semiconductor so they can etch microscopic patterns onto the chip.
The latest and greatest in chip design is a 3nm (nanometer) chip, which means the distance between transistors is at a minimum of 3nm wide. For reference, a human hair is between 80,000 and 100,000 nanometers wide.
While only a handful of companies can manufacture 3nm chips (Taiwan Semiconductor being one of them), only one creates the machines that make this technology possible: ASML. This makes these two companies fantastic investments based on their technological capabilities.
However, there's one overarching threat to both companies: China.
While the China invasion worries over Taiwan have died down, it is still a real possibility. Any action against Taiwan would sink Taiwan Semiconductor's stock (along with almost every other stock that uses Taiwan Semiconductor chips, like Apple and Nvidia). So avoiding TSMC because of this worry isn't wise, as iPhones and GPUs that power much of our computing infrastructure would have a part shortage and tank the market in general.
ASML also has to deal with China bans, as the Dutch government doesn't want the company to export its top-end EUV machines to China. So, ASML sends China its DUV machines, which are less powerful and can only produce chips 7nm in size. There is always a possibility that ASML may be prohibited from exporting any of its products to China, which would be an issue, as 46% of ASML's Q3 and 24% of Q2's new machine sales came from China.
This makes China a large part of the investment risk for both companies, but with how destabilized the world's economy would become if an attack happened, I don't think it's a valid reason not to invest. However, it's something to keep an eye on.
Despite these risks, both stocks look like strong buys right now.
Trading at recent valuation lows
If you look at each company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at face value, it may appear Taiwan Semiconductor is far cheaper than ASML, which is true. However, Taiwan Semiconductor is a cyclical business, as demand for its chips rises and falls based on consumer appetite. Planning and ordering machines from ASML takes some time, so it isn't as affected by consumer trends. For example, ASML's revenue backlog (for machines already ordered) sits at 35 billion euros, compared to Q3 system sales of 5.3 billion euros.
As a result, ASML has a higher valuation, which it has rightfully earned.
Both companies are trading well below their five-year historical average P/E ratio, which tells me each stock is undervalued in its own right.
With each company slated to capitalize on a chip boom that artificial intelligence (AI) computing creates, I think each stock is a buy right now. But if you forced me to pick one, I'd likely side with Taiwan Semiconductor because of its lower starting valuation.

NVDA,2023-12-15 21:00:00,A new product could be a game changer.,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has had one incredible year. The price of its shares has almost doubled in 2023, increasing 98% as of this writing. Indeed, when ranking all S&P 500 components by year-to-date performance, AMD ranks seventh -- overshadowed only by 2023 fireballs like Nvidia and Meta Platforms.
At any rate, as the year draws to an end, investors want to know if the good times will continue for AMD. Here are two reasons to think they will -- and one reason to believe they won't.
Reason No. 1 to buy: AMD's latest AI chip is a beast
If there's one reason to buy AMD right now, it's artificial intelligence (AI). It seems that right now, every single day brings a new AI innovation. This means demand for the semiconductors that power AI supercomputers is booming.
Crucially, only a few companies design the graphics processing units (GPUs) favored by software designers that train the large language models (LLMs) behind today's cutting-edge AI. One of those companies is Nvidia. Its H100 GPU is the most-sought AI chip around. It often sells for tens of thousands of dollars, and wait times for new deliveries can be months long.
That's why AMD's latest chip offering could be such a game changer. On Dec. 6, the company debuted its new MI300X chip. With it, AMD aims to compete directly with Nvidia's H100. According to AMD, the MI300X is faster than the H100 and delivers up to 60% increased performance.
If those performance figures bear out, it could be a boon for the AI sector in general -- and AMD in particular. With demand for generative AI through the roof, AMD could see a windfall in sales and profits if it were to unseat Nvidia as the king of AI chips.
Reason No. 2 to buy: Customers are lining up for its new AI chips
At any rate, there's little doubt there will be a significant market for the MI300X. Even if the chip doesn't live up to AMD's hype, there's still a huge supply and demand mismatch within the industry. And with the MI300X, AMD is poised to increase supply and capture market share.
To that end, this is what AMD CEO Lisa Su said during the MI300X introduction:
Customers are already on board with the new MI300X. Microsoft has announced that its new Azure virtual machines, designed for AI applications, will use the new AMD chips. In addition, AMD noted that Meta, Broadcom, and Cisco, among others, are working with AMD to develop advanced AI systems.
In short, there's plenty of room for AMD in the AI chip market. So, while the jury's still out on whether it can take significant market share from Nvidia, there's little doubt that the MI300X should provide a substantial boost to AMD's top and bottom lines.
One reason to sell: Valuation
Growth is one of the hardest things to find on Wall Street, which is why investors often have to pay up to get it. That's certainly the case for AMD.
The company's shares now trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10. That's the highest level since early 2022, and more than double the stock's 10-year average P/S ratio of 4.5.
In part, that's why AMD, despite its great leadership and solid growth prospects, isn't a fit for every investor. Its high valuation, combined with its reliance on a booming tech market, will rule it out for value-oriented investors or for those who already have a large concentration in the semiconductor industry or tech stocks in general.
However, for growth-oriented investors willing to hold for the long term, AMD should remain a name to watch. Thanks to its new AI chip, the company is well positioned to take the fight to Nvidia, which could send its stock much higher in the years to come.

NVDA,2023-12-15 21:10:13,Intel jumped after announcing new AI chips set to arrive in 2024.,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) rose as much as 4.6% early Friday, then settled to trade up 1.7% as of 3:30 p.m. ET after the company announced a new generative artificial intelligence (AI) chip that could rival competitive offerings from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
Intel gains ground in the AI chip race
Intel introduced several new chips at its AI Everywhere launch event in New York City on Thursday. But investors were arguably most excited after the company offered its first sneak peek at the new Intel Gaudi3 AI accelerator, a powerful chip focused on deep learning and large-scale generative AI models.
Intel says the Gaudi3 will offer a significant performance increase from its predecessor, the Gaudi2, that should make it competitive with rival AI accelerators already unveiled by both Nvidia and AMD. In its launch event press release yesterday, Intel added that it's enjoyed a ""rapid expansion of its Guadi pipeline due to growing and proven performance advantages combined with highly competitive TCO [total cost of ownership] and pricing.""
What's next for Intel stock?
AMD stock also soared last week after the company launched its new line of large accelerated processing units (APUs) designed for AI workloads. AMD CEO Lisa Su suggested at the time that the new products should enable her company to ""get a nice piece"" of what they expect will grow into a more than $400 billion market opportunity for AI chips by 2027.
Nvidia currently dominates that industry, commanding an estimated 80% market share in AI chips and leaving plenty of room for competitors like AMD and Intel to muscle their way in. With Intel's new Gaudi3 AI accelerator on schedule to arrive in 2024, it should be sufficiently early to capitalize on this mammoth opportunity.

NVDA,2023-12-15 21:15:16,"The ""Wizard of Wharton"" sees the Fed cutting interest rates five or six times next year, driving up stock and house prices and avoiding a recession.","Jeremy Siegel sees stocks and home prices rising, interest rates dropping, and no recession in 2024.
The ""Wizard of Wharton"" expects value and small stocks to outpace the ""Magnificent Seven"" next year.
Siegel predicts the Fed will cut rates by five or six times to below 4% in 2024.
Stocks and house prices will jump, the economy will skirt a recession, and interest rates will tumble in 2024, Jeremy Siegel says.
""The Dow just surged to an all-time high,"" the retired finance professor known as the ""Wizard of Wharton"" said during his keynote at VettaFi's 2024 Market Outlook Symposium on Thursday. ""The S&P is going to follow very soon,"" he predicted, according to a post on VettaFi's website.
The benchmark S&P 500 index has rallied 23% this year to trade at 4,720 points as of Thursday's close — just 2% below its all-time intraday high of 4,819 points in January 2022. Its gains were driven by the ""Magnificent Seven"" this year, a group of Big Tech stocks that includes Tesla and Nvidia. But Siegel predicted the market would see a reversal in 2024, with value and small stocks rising by 10% to 15% to outperform large growth stocks.
The overall market also looks healthier to him now the frenzy around cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, and fad stocks has faded.
""The speculation that the pandemic darlings like Peloton, some of the craziness in the crypto market, some of the craziness in the NFT market, that's gone,"" he said. ""The quality growth stocks reasserted themselves, the Googles, the Nvidias, the Teslas, the Amazons.""
The senior economist at ETF-provider WisdomTree also issued a bullish outlook for the housing market. Mortgage rates have surged to two-decade highs as a result of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to crush elevated inflation. That has basically frozen the market, as prospective sellers who've locked in cheap mortgages are loath to list their homes, while buyers are balking at paying top dollar and taking on much larger monthly payments than they wanted.
""I would imagine we could have a rise in housing prices of 4% or 5% in 2024,"" Siegel said, likely because he expects interest rates to fall, reducing mortgage rates and freeing up cash to spend on homes.
""I think we may have five or six rate cuts,"" Siegel said about the outlook for next year, basing his prediction on inflation slowing and commodity prices dropping in recent months. His comment suggests the Fed could lower its benchmark rate from upwards of 5.25% today to below 4% in under a year.
Siegel also expressed surprise at how the American economy has kept growing solidly despite the Fed's hikes, and said that could mean it escapes a recession entirely.
""The indications for a soft landing are certainly increasing and I would say are odds on now for 2024,"" he said.
Siegel, the author of ""Stocks for the Long Run,"" is frequently bullish on the stock market's prospects, but his optimistic outlook for this year proved prophetic.","Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel's 2024 outlook: Stocks and home prices will jump, interest rates will tumble, and recession won't hit",483.5,488.89999,500.76999,12,2023,15
NVDA,2023-12-15 22:22:00,Ark Invest funds have been buying the dip in Palantir stock following a negative report from a Wall Street analyst.,"When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks probably come to mind. The moniker includes the majority of megacap companies leading the AI revolution: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.
One company that might be getting overlooked in the AI arms race is Palantir (NYSE: PLTR). While the data analytics company is best known for its close ties to the U.S. military and its allies, Palantir is far more than a government contractor. It has a growing presence in the private sector and works with customers across a variety of markets.
Yet despite this, the stock is trading roughly 50% below its all-time highs. And while some on Wall Street remain skeptical of Palantir's long-term potential, one notable investor in particular has been buying the dip. The funds of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood have ratcheted up their buying of Palantir as of late.
For the trading period between Dec. 6 and Dec. 15, Ark funds purchased 1.7 million shares in Palantir stock across three exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While the company represents only 1.2% of Ark's combined portfolio, it has a bigger position than most of the Magnificent Seven stocks.
With the stock trading for just $18 per share as of this writing, now is a terrific time to assess Palantir's prospects.
What's going on?
A recent bearish analyst report from investment bank William Blair spurred a sell-off in Palantir stock that wiped nearly $4 billion off its market capitalization.
William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma expressed concerns about a contract that Palantir has with the U.S. Army, suggesting that the upcoming renewal of that contract may be for less than the original deal's value. As of this morning, Dec. 15, Palantir helped curtail those worries as the Army contract renewed for an additional year. While the initial deal was a multiyear contract, long-term investors shouldn't get hung up on the extension being for only one year. Rather, there are several reasons why investors should believe the sell-off was overblown and could be a buying opportunity.
Demand for AI-powered services is off the charts
It's important to keep in mind that the Army contract is just one deal. The advancements Palantir has made in artificial intelligence have led to a surge in demand for its services that I think is being overlooked. Earlier this year, it released a new product called the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which uses generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to help solve complex operational challenges.
While this may sound similar to the solutions offered by some of the big tech giants, Palantir may have an edge thanks to its creative lead generation strategy. The company has been hosting immersive seminars it calls ""boot camps,"" at which prospective customers can test out its software platforms. The goal of these events is to quickly identify use cases for its services, giving Palantir an opportunity to sell products and expand sales to customers as time goes on.
While the boot camps are still a new innovation for the company, demand to attend them is off the charts. During Palantir's third-quarter earnings call, Chief Technoloyg Officer Shyam Sankar said, ""we're running more boot camps per month than we had U.S. commercial pilots all last year."" The company had conducted boot camps for 200 organizations through November.
These boot camps represent a way for Palantir to potentially capture a piece of the growing AI market for little cost, and perhaps shorten its sales cycle significantly. As companies attend the seminars and convert into paying customers, Palantir has an opportunity to cross-sell and upsell products at a faster rate. In theory, this should help it accelerate its revenue growth while keeping its spending on sales, marketing, and customer retention low.
Is Palantir's valuation justified?
The chart below shows that Palantir's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 19 is currently well above its one-year average and inching toward prior highs. While this may seem a little rich, I see Palantir as deserving of a premium.
Unlike many of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) cohorts, Palantir is already profitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. In fact, given its consistent profits, Palantir is eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, a huge milestone for any company. The thing long-term investors should be considering here is the pace at which Palantir's offerings are being adopted and deployed.
For instance, during Q3 Palantir nearly tripled its AIP users. According to management, since its launch five months ago, 300 unique organizations have deployed AIP. While it's clear that the boot camps are driving interest in Palantir's products, investors should keep in mind that these prospects are contributing little to no revenue for Palantir today. Rather, it's the rising interest in attending and testing out AIP that could serve as a proxy of what Palantir's future could look like. It's these long-term secular tailwinds that attract investors like Wood, and underscore her conviction to buy when the stock falls off a cliff.
In the long run, Palantir's ability to accelerate revenue growth while also sustaining profits looks achievable. As the stock experiences some pronounced selling activity, now looks like an incredible opportunity to begin dollar-cost averaging into a long-term position for this AI disrupter.

NVDA,2023-12-19 12:17:00,"Nvidia may have reached the $1 trillion club, but the stock looks cheap compared to its peers.","Artificial intelligence (AI) dominated financial headlines throughout 2023. While myriad companies are participating in the AI marathon, the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are setting the pace. Among this cohort of stocks, perhaps the biggest beneficiary from the AI boom is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company recently reported earnings for its third quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Oct. 29, handily beating its revenue guidance and setting a new record.
But even after its 240% stock return so far this year, there are plenty of reasons to believe the party is just getting started for Nvidia. Let's dig into the tailwinds pushing demand for the company's semiconductor chips and assess if now is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
Artificial intelligence is fueling demand
Nvidia specializes in the production of graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs play a critical role in gaming, crypto mining, and AI. When it comes to AI use cases, GPU chips are designed to help power large language models (LLMs). This is important because LLMs are a core component of generative AI applications.
Given the skyrocketing rise of Microsoft's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard, it's easy to draw a dotted line connecting Nvidia to a host of other major AI players. To get a sense of just how much demand Nvidia is experiencing, let's take a look at the company's financial picture and how its valuation has shifted.
Nvidia's path to a $1 trillion valuation
The table below illustrates some of Nvidia's key financial metrics over the last year.
Data source: Nvidia Investor Relations.
You can see that Nvidia's revenue has increased by 206% over the last year. But perhaps even better is the company's bottom line. The impressive margin expansion has helped fuel a rise in profits, as diluted earnings per share increased from $0.27 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $3.71 for the most recent quarter -- over 12,000% growth in just one year.
Nvidia's eye-popping growth on both the revenue and earnings lines sheds light not only on the demand for its products, but the pricing power that the company can command given its market-leading position.
The chart above illustrates Nvidia's market cap over the last year. Since its fiscal third quarter 2022, Nvidia's market cap has grown over 200% to eclipse $1 trillion. Although this valuation might appear steep, a thorough analysis benchmarked against its peers might prove otherwise.
Should you buy Nvidia stock in 2024?
The chart below illustrates Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to its ""Magnificent Seven"" cohorts. Investors can see that Nvidia's forward P/E of roughly 40 is right in the middle of the pack. What is actually surprising to me is that Tesla, which is a known customer of Nvidia, is trading at a forward P/E nearly double that of Nvidia's.
Perhaps an even more head-scratching dynamic can be seen in the chart below.
Advanced Micro Devices is Nvidia's top rival. While AMD has been posting some impressive results of its own, the disparity between its forward P/E and Nvidia's is astounding. It may sound convoluted to say that a trillion-dollar company is cheap. But when you measure Nvidia against its megacap peers as well as its No. 1 rival, the case for buying the stock becomes increasingly clear.
As demand for AI applications continues to gain momentum, I see Nvidia continuing to play an integral role. And with the stock trading at discounts to smaller rivals as well as end customers reliant on the company's technology, now looks like a terrific opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares.

NVDA,2023-12-19 12:30:00,Taiwan Semiconductor has a vital product for many of the most important tech companies.,"Many components are necessary for complicated devices like cellphones and graphics processing units, and none are more vital than the microscopic chips that provide the computing power. Among the chip manufacturers, none is more important than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.
It's already a monster with a $536 billion market cap. But could it grow enough to reach $1 trillion by 2030? Let's take a look.
Taiwan Semiconductor has some big-name clients
As the name implies, Taiwan Semiconductor (also commonly referred to as TSMC) is based in Taiwan. However, it's made several investments in the U.S., most notably its chip plant in Arizona. While this facility has had multiple problems starting up, it will eventually provide an additional source for these vital chips.
Among the reasons TSMC has been so successful is due to its best-in-class technology. Likewise, Samsung and Intel are among its chief competitors; however, they compete with many of Taiwan Semiconductor's largest clients, like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD. These companies don't want to give their business to competitors, so they'd rather give it to a neutral third party like Taiwan Semiconductor.
When it comes to technology, Samsung and TSMC have left Intel in the dust. Taiwan Semiconductor is ramping up its production of 3 nm (nanometer) chips and is scheduled to start producing 2 nm products in 2025. Additionally, there are rumors of 1.4 nm chips being developed after that. Taiwan Semiconductor has a built-in revenue escalator every couple of years when it launches new products.
Upgraded chips and the demand for technology will push TSMC higher over the next decade. But will it be enough for the company to cross the $1 trillion valuation threshold?
The stock trades at a discount to the market
At its peak in early 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor held a market cap of nearly $730 billion. However, as chip demand subsided in 2022, the stock came tumbling down. This has weighed on TSMC's financials throughout 2023, although management believes the chip supply glut has nearly bottomed.
This sets the stage for a strong rebound in 2024 and beyond, as Wall Street analysts project 20% revenue growth in 2024. They also believe it will produce earnings per share of $6.12.
The downturn Taiwan Semiconductor's stock experienced in 2022 wasn't all due to a shrinking business. Some of it had to do with multiple contraction, which happens when investors aren't willing to pay as high a price for a stock than they normally would.
With Taiwan Semiconductor settling in around its long-term average, the stock looks fairly priced from a historical perspective. However, I'd argue that this price doesn't fully value the company. The S&P 500 trades at about 26 times earnings right now, which means the stock trades at a 29% discount to the market.
I have a hard time believing that Taiwan Semiconductor is a below-average business in the S&P 500, and if Taiwan Semiconductor can achieve analysts' projections for 2024 and trade at an earnings multiple of 22, it will have a market cap of nearly $700 billion.
If TSMC can grow its earnings at a 12% pace for five years (taking it to the start of 2030), it will be worth $1.23 trillion. Those don't seem like far-fetched estimates, and they make a pretty solid case for Taiwan Semiconductor to be worth at least $1 trillion by the start of 2030.
Furthermore, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 14.9%, which would demolish the long-term returns of the broader market.
As a result, I think Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent investment over the next five to 10 years.

NVDA,2023-12-19 14:53:00,Its positioning in biotech will likely take a long while to pay off.,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on a shopping spree in the biotech industry. While it has no intention of developing medicines or pharmaceutical technologies for the laboratory, its strategy clearly calls for getting some exposure to the sector, and when it makes a move, others tend to follow.
But how could making investments in an area so far outside of its traditional wheelhouse end up supporting shareholder value in the future rather than destroying it? Let's dive in and examine why it's staking out its biotech claims.
A certain kind of biotech is getting all of the attention
Nvidia isn't cutting deals and making investments in just any old biotech. Its quarries are biotechs using artificial intelligence (AI) as part of their drug discovery and development process. In July, the chipmaker made a $50 million equity investment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a biotech dedicated to developing medicines more efficiently using its AI platform.
But that's just one out of an ever-growing handful of investments it's making in the space. In 2023 alone, it invested in at least six different AI-enabled biotechs in the U.S. and the U.K. It's also pursuing a collaboration in drug development using AI with Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche.
While the sizes of its investments are often not disclosed, one thing's for sure. With more than $18 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on hand, Nvidia has an abundance of funds available to allocate to potential drivers for its long-term growth.
At first glance, biotech seems like it's an odd fit for Nvidia's traditional business model of developing and selling new chips and computing services. But in the broader context of being in the early days of the ongoing AI revolution, these plays make a lot more sense.
It's currently developing a service it calls BioNeMo, which it markets as an AI platform for accelerating drug discovery. Both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Schrodinger, which are already popular AI-driven drug discovery biotechs in their own right, are paid collaborators contributing to the service's capabilities.
Eventually, BioNeMo could be the go-to tool for biopharmas at the very start of the drug discovery process. And that would open the door to charging them subscription fees or perhaps even a small cut of the royalties from any of the medicines commercialized with the help of the system.
These investments will take quite a while to pay off
Nvidia is currently working to develop a suite of services that would make it into an AI foundry of sorts, wherein all types of businesses rely on it to help them build AI systems that are adapted to their specific needs. But today, despite its run of investments in biotech, its revenue from all healthcare sources combined is marginal and well beneath $1 billion annually.
That makes it insignificant in comparison to the $18 billion it brought in during the third quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, the most recent quarter. The segment isn't even mentioned consistently in its earnings materials or investor presentations -- at least for now.
At the moment, Nvidia is clearly positioning itself to gain from any breakthroughs or progress made in the field of AI for drug discovery by incorporating elements from the most promising players into its own AI platform via its investments. It can likely realize some value from its committed cash if it can onboard more customers to its drug development platform.
But getting new customers will be a lot easier a few years down the line, when the biotechs contributing to its platform today will be approaching the commercialization of the medicines they made with the help of AI, not to mention Nvidia. If regulators grant those biotechs permission to sell their drugs, it'll be possible to do a retrospective analysis regarding the utility that AI provided along the way.
Once there are clear examples of success in using AI to make the drug development process faster, more reliable, and cheaper, companies will flock to use its tools for their own benefit, and that could drive some more significant revenue growth.
Will Nvidia's revenue from biopharma services ever approach the tens of billions that it makes from its other segments? Probably not. Still, it's very probable that at least a few of the bets it made recently will have huge returns that'll grow the value of the business.
Diversifying into a new area will also provide a bit of downside protection in case its other segments struggle. And for a headline-driven stock like Nvidia's, it's always beneficial to get another injection of good news to build the hype up even further.
So keep your eyes out for news of more biopharma investment activity -- it won't make much of a difference today, but in the long run, it's a bullish driver for Nvidia stock.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Robinhood Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.
It has been astonishing to witness the incredible rise of stock trading applications in the past few years as tech-led disruption upends the finance markets around the globe. One of the biggest winners from this change has been Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), a California-based financial services firm that offers commission-free trades. The reason that these applications are so popular is that they have given more power to retail investors. The Robinhood business is worth more than $11 billion and has over 20 million funded accounts.
Retail investors have become a dominant market force through the use of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD). Latest figures reveal that users on the platform who engage in trades have an average age of just thirty one. Over half of the total users on the platform are first time traders. The company, founded in 2013, debuted on the market in 2021 and was valued at more than $32 billion at the time. Since then, inflationary pressures and recession fears have pummeled growth stocks, although they are now starting to recover from these challenges.
Some of the top Robinhood stocks to buy according to hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), among others discussed in detail below. Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), recently highlighted how the advent of stocks trading apps had transformed finance, with individual stock trades going up even as the popularity of index funds reaches new highs.
“Our surviving competitors have been forced to adopt our business model and even to adapt their user interfaces to be similar to ours. And Robinhood is no longer just the trading app, we've been rapidly evolving into a broad financial services platform serving multiple financial needs, including spending, savings, and retirement. Our ambition and the opportunity ahead of us has expanded greatly. And so, it still feels like we are at the beginning of our journey.
We're still No. 2 in retail trading market share in the US. We're at the very early stages of expanding beyond trading, with just over $1 billion of retirement assets on our platform, out of the over $12 trillion US IRA market. We're also just now beginning to take our first steps to serve customers outside the US, where we believe the need and opportunity for innovation in financial services is even greater than it is domestically.
As we continue to execute on our strategy, we believe we can grow into one of the largest and most profitable financial companies in the world.”

If you want to read about some more Roth IRA stocks, go directly to 5 Best Roth IRA Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.
In 2022, recession fears had clouded the marketplace as the Federal Reserve in the United States raised interest rates to tame inflation. This had resulted in a massive drop in the prices of growth stocks. These growth stocks, in recent years, have come to dominate the US stock market, morphing into trillion dollar corporations. Growth investors had seized the opportunity to pick up the shares of firms like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at discount prices during the rut.
These investors are now repairing the benefits of these trades. Per latest figures, the shares of these three firms are all up this year, by 25%, 55%, and 245% respectively. There is little doubt that these tech firms still have a formidable runway for growth. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is investing heavily in the rapidly expanding blockchain space, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is starting to realize the benefits of the entry into the massive video game business, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) looks set to be an industry leader in AI products.
Stocks like these, with growth prospects but solid fundamentals, generally make for the best investments in Roth IRA. Roth IRA are accounts that offer people the benefits of tax-free growth and withdrawals after retirement. Since equity investments are also covered under these benefits, many investors are on the lookout for a reasonable stock that offers growth potential but has a strong core business. They are inspired by Peter Thiel, an investor who turned his $2,000 Roth IRA equity investment into a billion dollar retirement plan.
The growth prospects offered by tech behemoths can be understood in greater detail by following the business plans of these firms. Colette Kress, the CFO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently outlined these during the third quarter earnings call. Kress highlighted how the hardware products of the firm were essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures, and the firm planned to ramp up the production of these AI chips heading into 2024.
“The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants with their pipelines. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla and autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our data center revenue in the quarter.
Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances and high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities.”

Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) with 1.9 million shares worth more than 306 million.
Just like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is one of the best Roth IRA stocks to buy according to hedge funds.
In its Q3 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”
10. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52
AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. On October 21, Citi analyst Michael Rollins maintained a Buy rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stock and raised the price target to $18 from $17.
At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.7 billion in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 56 in the preceding quarter worth $1.4 billion.
9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57
The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. On December 13, investment advisory Citi maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $67 from $65.
Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Omaha, Nebraska-based firm Berkshire Hathaway is a leading shareholder in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with 400 million shares worth more than $22 billion.
In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Hayden Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.
Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.
I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.
But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”
Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”
8. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64
CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. On December 6, Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson maintained an Outperform rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock and raised the price target to $85 from $80.
Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm AQR Capital Management is a leading shareholder in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with 4.4 million shares worth more than $307 million.
In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Patient Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“Our largest new position was CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS). We owned CVS in 2021 through call options, which provided a handsome return. We sold it when it reached our assessment of intrinsic value. In the first half of the year, the stock traded down nearly 40% from its highs. CVS is valued like a pharmacy business in secular decline, while its strategy and assets are far better. CVS owns a healthcare benefits business (Aetna) and a pharmacy-benefits manager (Caremark). It recently acquired Signify Health and Oak Street Health, entering the In-Home Evaluations and primary care spaces enhancing the company’s ability to offer comprehensive healthcare services as we transition to a system more focused on value-based care. Short-term headwinds, such as an unwind from COVID, some unfavorable health care developments and negative headlines from PBM contract losses, weighed on the price. The company is again significantly undervalued, with a trough-level 8.2x P/E multiple well below peers’ 12.2x, with a 3.5% dividend yield. We saw an opportunity to diversify the portfolio with a stable company with a promising strategy and group of assets at an attractive price.”
7. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75
The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) provides branded consumer packaged goods worldwide. On November 13, investment advisory Jefferies initiated coverage of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $177.
At the end of the third quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.7 billion in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared to 74 in the preceding quarter worth $5.3 billion.
In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Hayden Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:
“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, Coca-Cola trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is likewise at ~27x P/E, with earnings only ~12% higher than a decade ago (or a ~1% annual growth rate). This equates to a mere 3.3% – 3.7% earnings yield.
Both of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.
I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.
But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.
Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”

NVDA,2023-12-20 10:12:00,"The company has massive earnings potential in AI, but its valuation leaves something to be desired.","It's hard not to be bullish about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). The company's stock has more than doubled in 2023, up some 115% since Jan. 1. Meanwhile, it appears to be making promising headway in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market.
The company's biggest competitor, Nvidia, has enjoyed soaring earnings this year thanks to a spike in demand for AI chips. Nvidia's performance over the last 12 months could mean big things for AMD in 2024 as AMD plans to launch a powerful new graphics processing unit (GPU). If AMD can replicate even a portion of Nvidia's success in the industry, the company could expect major gains next year.
As a result, now is the perfect time to learn more about this tech giant and determine whether it's worth adding to your portfolio. So, is AMD's stock a buy now? Let's take a look.
AMD likely has a bright future in AI over the long term
Many companies across tech have restructured their businesses to focus on AI in 2023, with several venturing into the hardware side of the industry. Tech firms like Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft all have plans to eventually challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and take a slice of the lucrative market.
However, AMD likely has the best chance to thrive in the arena thanks to its years of being the second-biggest name in GPUs (second only to Nvidia). AMD has the brand recognition and infrastructure in place to catch up to its primary rival far quicker than other competitors.
AMD launched its MI300X AI GPU on Dec. 6. The new chip is reportedly faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU, offering up to 60% increased performance. If it can deliver competitive price-to-performance, AMD could see significant revenue gains over the next year.
Microsoft's Azure has already signed on to become the first cloud platform to use the chip. Meanwhile, Meta, Broadcom, and Cisco have partnered with AMD to build advanced AI systems.
The AI market exploded in 2023 and has shown no signs of slowing. Nvidia may have gotten a head start, but AMD looks likely to make a big splash next year, and you might not want to miss out on its growth potential.
Poor valuation makes other stocks more attractive for now
AMD's stock has skyrocketed this year, but its earnings still have yet to see a return on the chipmaker's heavy investment in AI. The chart below reflects this, with the company's free cash flow plunging nearly 60% year to date while Nvidia's more than tripled.
In the third quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 4% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $110 million. The growth was mainly owed to a 42% increase in AMD's client segment, which benefited from improvements in the personal computer market.
However, AMD's data center sales crucially fell about 1% as Nvidia cornered the market on chips. For reference, Nvidia's data center segment posted a 206% increase in revenue for the same quarter. The newly released MI300X could trigger a spike in AMD's data center revenue next year. However, until then, its stock might be too expensive to justify.
The tables above compare AMD's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow against the same metrics for some of the biggest names in AI right now. AMD has the highest figures on both fronts by a significant margin, meaning its stock offers the least value out of all these companies.
AMD is on a promising growth trajectory and will likely flourish over the long term. However, its high valuation is hard to justify with options like Alphabet and Microsoft as alternative ways to invest in AI. Even Nvidia's high stock price is more attractive, with better valuation metrics and a more established position in the industry.
It's wise to keep AMD on your radar to strike when the time is right, but cheaper options are too good to pass up for now.

NVDA,2023-12-20 10:35:00,These beaten-down stocks could deliver huge returns for investors.,"Spurred by market-moving trends, including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), 2023 has been a great year for growth stocks. Explosive gains for companies including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple helped to push the S&P 500 index up roughly 24% across this year's trading. Meanwhile, the even more growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite index has surged 43% across the stretch.
Of course, the explosive gains for growth stocks this year also have to be viewed in the context of big sell-offs that took place in 2022. And while some large tech companies have come roaring back to reach new valuation highs this year, the market-shaping recovery has been unevenly distributed. Some fantastic companies with explosive potential still trade at big discounts compared to previous highs, and investors still have plenty of opportunities to capitalize.
If you're looking for top growth stocks still trading at levels that leave room for explosive returns, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors believe you should buy these stocks before 2023 falls off the calendar.
This beaten-down growth stock could soar
Keith Noonan: Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) is a leading online social entertainment platform. While the company's service is often thought of as a video game platform, it actually hosts an incredible breadth of games and social experiences. In modern terms, Roblox is better described as a metaverse -- and it's one of the most successful takes on creating a thriving online virtual world so far.
But while Roblox's long-term growth trajectory and recent business performance have been quite impressive, the company's stock performance is best described as volatile. When the company went public in March 2021, it was still seeing elevated engagement levels related to social-distancing policies stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Reserve had also yet to kick off its accelerated program of interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and the market's appetite for growth stocks was still relatively high.
Business and market conditions changed quickly in 2022, and Roblox got crushed. The company went through a period in which engagement and sales growth were hampered by the easing of pandemic-related conditions, and investors quickly fell out of love with the stock.
But even though the business has returned to setting new engagement records and posting strong sales and bookings growth, the market remained lukewarm on Roblox. With the company's share price still down 67% from its high, I think that investors can score wins by capitalizing on the disparity between the metaverse leader's stock moves and its recent business performance and long-term growth potential.
With revenue surging 38% year over year to reach $713.2 million in the third quarter, concerns about Roblox being a flash in the pan can be safely set aside. Even better, the company is still in the early stages of rolling out its digital advertising and generative artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.
Roblox still has massive growth opportunities ahead, and investors could score wins by building a position in the stock while it's still down big from its previous peak.
Fearing artificial intelligence, Fiverr is selling cheaply.
Parkev Tatevosian: Fiverr International's (NYSE: FVRR) stock price is down a whopping 91% off its high water mark reached in 2021. While the company faces some challenges, notably the impact of AI on its business, I think the sell-off is overdone. Meanwhile, Fiverr continues to demonstrate excellent revenue growth and it's making progress on profitability.
Indeed, from 2017 to 2022, Fiverr's revenue expanded from $52 million to $337 million. The company operates a platform that brings together buyers and sellers of services. For instance, someone who wants to hire an individual to make YouTube thumbnails can find plenty of choices on the Fiverr platform.
For its services, Fiverr takes a fee from each transaction occurring on its platform. That has proven to be a scalable business model, as Fiverr's operating income has improved from negative $8 million to negative $2 million from the June-ended quarter in 2021 to the September-ended quarter in 2023.
The business model is built to scale efficiently, as Fiverr does not need major capital investments to grow the business. The primary factor for growth will continue to be Fiverr to build its ecosystem, attracting more buyers and sellers to sign up.
Fiverr stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12, a relatively cheap valuation for a company with its growth characteristics. Of course, there is reason for the discount.
AI threatens to replace some of the services offered on the Fiverr platform. Rather than hiring someone on Fiverr to complete a service, businesses can use AI to complete the task. That might be true to some level, but I think there is an overreaction to the risk, and Fiverr stock could be an excellent growth stock to buy for long-term investors.

NVDA,2023-12-20 13:05:00,Alphabet and Microsoft are vying for the generative AI throne.,"Financial headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) dominated 2023, with the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks of Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Nvidia garnering most of the attention.
Microsoft kicked off the AI arms race following a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Not long after, Alphabet debuted its own large language model (LLM) called Bard. Let's just say the initial reaction from Bard was underwhelming, given the chatbot didn't exactly provide accurate answers to basic questions during its public unveiling.
Nevertheless, as ChatGPT continued to gain momentum in the public eye, Alphabet doubled down and kept working. Earlier this month, Alphabet unveiled its latest installment in generative AI, called Gemini.
Make no mistake about it -- Alphabet's Gemini release is a calculated chess move during otherwise tumultuous times at OpenAI and the potential repercussions for Microsoft. Could now be a buying opportunity in Alphabet stock before the company begins reaping the benefits of its new AI product?
Is Gemini better than ChatGPT?
If you're wondering whether Alphabet just leapfrogged Microsoft and asking which generative AI application is more powerful, welcome to the club. This is, quite literally, the billion-dollar question. According to research at Goldman Sachs, generative AI has the potential to increase gross domestic product (GDP) by $7 trillion over the next decade -- a theme that is sparking interest across Wall Street.
A couple of months ago, it was revealed that famed hedge fund manager Bill Ackman took a sizable stake in Alphabet. During a fireside chat with CNBC's Scott Wapner, Ackman spoke about his bullish thesis on Alphabet. The bottom line is that Ackman is attracted to Alphabet's ecosystem, which stems across Google Search, productivity applications such as Gmail, video website YouTube, and the company's growing cloud business. In his view, Alphabet is uniquely positioned to integrate artificial intelligence across its entire suite of services, thereby becoming invaluable for end users.
The obvious undercurrent of Gemini is that it could further boost the demand for Alphabet's various products, making it appear lucrative and validating Ackman's hypothesis. But I'd caution investors to zoom out and really consider the full picture here.
Like Alphabet, Microsoft also has a compelling ecosystem. Per the company's latest earnings report, Microsoft experienced more demand for its AI applications than it was expecting. And while OpenAI has helped fuel growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud segment, the real opportunities may just be getting started.
Given the tailwinds pushing both Alphabet and Microsoft, I think it's a little early to declare one generative AI application as superior. For investors seriously considering a position in Alphabet, analysis beyond AI potential is required.
Alphabet's valuation looks really attractive
There are several ways to assess a stock when it comes to valuation. One measure that can be useful is looking at a company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple benchmarked against a set of peers.
The chart above illustrates that Alphabet's forward P/E of 23 is the lowest among its Magnificent Seven cohorts. Of note, Microsoft's forward P/E of 33 is well above Alphabet, thereby signaling the markets are applying a premium to the Windows developer.
Going beyond forward P/E, the chart below illustrates the company's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio over the last decade. At a multiple of 22.4, Alphabet stock is trading at a massive discount to its 10-year average, and quite close to its low point of 18.1. This looks like yet another sign that the markets are discounting Alphabet stock and its robust business model. In fact, the company's consistent free cash flow generation is what provides Alphabet with the financial flexibility to invest in new growth areas such as AI.
Should you buy Alphabet stock?
Alphabet stock looks quite cheap at its current trading levels, especially compared to its competition. The secular tailwinds fueling artificial intelligence coupled with the company's institutional support are reasons to be optimistic. However, given the company's sheer dominance in its core online advertising business and its contribution to help fund other growth drivers, like the cloud and AI, don't seem to be appreciated. This most likely stems from the fact that some believe ChatGPT will begin replacing Google Search, putting Alphabet in an existential crisis.
If the valuation analysis above shows anything, it may imply that the thesis that Microsoft is going to dethrone Alphabet in online search is shortsighted. Given Alphabet is the home of the world's top two most visited websites (Google and YouTube), advertisers are keen to utilize these platforms. And since 2024 is the beginning of a new election cycle, research suggests that it could be a record year for political advertising campaigns -- a theme that should benefit Alphabet greatly.
Moreover, it's clear that the addressable market for artificial intelligence is not only large, but still evolving. As applications and use cases multiply, there will likely be several winners. As the stock trades at historically low levels, now could be a unique opportunity to begin dollar-cost averaging into Alphabet. Both the near-term and long-term pictures look strong, and investors should take advantage of the discounted trading multiples right now.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock almost tripled in the first 3 quarters of this year with a 197% gain, and a large reason for this is the huge role they have played in recent AI improvements. Nvidia’s single GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic 1000x in 10 years with only 2.5x coming from Moore’s Law3 driven increases in chip density. Besides better chip manufacturing, there were three other improvement factors at play: simplifications in number representation for the weights of the neural networks, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculations, and increased neuron sparsity (in neural networks, some neurons are useless and can be pruned from the network without reducing performance significantly). In addition to these single GPU improvements, Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together.
It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the improvement came from hardware architectural and software data improvements, rather than transition density. These improvements were likely the low-hanging fruit of training speed improvements as researchers will eventually converge on an ideal architecture. The simplification of going from 32-bit to 8-bit floating point numbers for measuring weights is a one-time gain that can’t be repeated again. I expect the rate of improvement to slow down over the next ten years and eventually approach the levels of Moore’s Law improvements in chip efficiency. The historical trend for computer hardware is for it to eventually be commoditized, and I believe this will eventually occur for Nvidia’s GPUs as well.""",NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Stock Tripled in 2023,496.04001,481.10999,489.89999,12,2023,20
NVDA,2023-12-20 13:55:00,"These two companies have given investors solid returns in 2023, and they look ready to do the same again.","The stock market has rallied impressively in 2023 thanks to multiple factors such as cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes, a robust U.S. economy, and a solid job market, all of which explains why the Nasdaq Composite index has shot up an impressive 41% this year.
The good news is that the stock market is expected to head higher in 2024, especially as the Fed is anticipated to cut interest rates three times next year. Bloomberg, for instance, forecasts that the S&P 500 index could hit record highs in 2024. A lower interest rate environment bodes well for growth stocks, which struggled last year when the Fed was continuously increasing rates.
Lower interest rates will allow growth-oriented companies to get access to capital at a lower cost, while also increasing the value of their future cash flows. That's why if you have $1,000 in investible cash after paying off your bills, clearing any high-interest debt, and saving enough for difficult times, it could be a good idea to put that money into the following growth stocks that could deliver healthy returns in 2024 and beyond.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a top growth play in 2023, turning a $1,000 investment made in the stock at the beginning of the year into more than $3,300 as of this writing.
What's worth noting here is that Nvidia stock is cheaper on a forward earnings basis compared to some of its peers in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which refers to a group of seven megacap tech companies that have been delivering significant gains recently.
Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who has a $750 price target on Nvidia stock, points out that the tech giant is cheaper than Apple and Microsoft as far as the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is concerned. As the following chart shows, only Meta Platforms and Alphabet are cheaper than Nvidia on a forward P/E basis.
Investors, therefore, can still consider buying Nvidia even though it has more than tripled this year. That's because the company's dominance of the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is likely to drive even stronger growth next year.
Nvidia is on track to end the current fiscal year with revenue of $59 billion, which would be a 119% jump over the prior year. The company's data center business has played a critical role in this impressive growth, as this segment has benefited from the AI chip boom. More specifically, 75% of the company's revenue has come from selling data center chips in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.
So, the data center business could end the year with $44 billion in revenue (based on the contribution of the data center business to Nvidia's top line and its full-year revenue forecast), which would be nearly triple the revenue it generated in fiscal 2023.
Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the AI chip market could be worth $45 billion this year. This means that Nvidia now has a terrific grip on this market. What's more, AMD estimates that the AI chip market could be worth a whopping $400 billion in 2027, multiplying almost 10 times within five years. Even if Nvidia loses share and ends up controlling half of this market at that time, its top line could hit $200 billion. That would be more than three times Nvidia's estimated fiscal 2024 revenue.
Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings growth to accelerate significantly over the next five years to an annual rate of 103% as compared to the 48% annual growth it has clocked in the past five years. As such, Nvidia seems capable of giving investors hefty returns in the future as well, which is why putting $1,000 into this tech stock seems like a good idea right now.
2. Micron Technology
A $1,000 investment in Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock at the beginning of the year is now worth just over $1,600. Shares of the memory specialist have benefited from the changing dynamics in the memory market, which has been under duress over the past couple of years on account of an oversupply.
Market research firm TrendForce estimates that the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) increased 18% quarter over quarter in the third quarter of 2023. The firm predicts that prices could jump another 13% to 18% in the current quarter. More importantly, Gartner is forecasting a massive increase of 66% in the memory market's revenue next year, which would be a big improvement over 2023's estimated decline of 39%.
There are multiple reasons the memory market is expected to turn around sharply next year. First, sales of personal computers are expected to recover 8% in 2024, following an estimated decline of 12.4% this year. Second, the smartphone market is also expected to rebound next year. And finally, new catalysts such as AI are going to drive an improvement in memory demand, and the good part is that Micron is well-placed to take advantage of the same.
Therefore, consensus estimates are pointing toward a significant acceleration in Micron's growth. The company is expected to deliver a 40% jump in revenue in the current fiscal year (which started in September 2023) to $21.8 billion, while its loss is expected to shrink to $1.21 per share from a loss of $4.45 per share in fiscal 2023. Even better, Micron is expected to sustain solid growth in the next fiscal year.
Given that Micron stock is currently trading at 5.7 times sales, investors are getting a good deal on it, considering the impressive growth that it is set to deliver. If Micron does hit $31 billion in revenue in a couple of years, as the estimates suggest and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could increase to $176 billion. That would be a 95% increase from current levels, indicating that a $1,000 investment in this semiconductor stock may double over the next two years.

NVDA,2023-12-20 14:00:00,"It isn't the first drugmaker to partner with the chipmaker, and it won't be the last.","In late November, Roche's (OTC: RHHBY) subsidiary Genentech and the chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) agreed to collaborate on developing new medicines using artificial intelligence (AI) over the next few years. While the pair didn't announce the financial terms of their partnership, the move is just one of a slew of similar deals between big pharmas and businesses making AI platforms to improve the drug discovery and development process.
Now, investors are left grappling with the question of what to make of the announcement, given that few concrete details are available. Let's clear up some of the confusion by putting the new collaboration into context and discussing some of its likely goals and impacts in the near future.
This revolution is just getting started
In theory, AI has a lot to offer drug developers like Roche. The drug development process can take upwards of a decade, not to mention billions of dollars in research and development (R&D) expenses. Even under the best conditions, candidates for new medicines can fail to perform as anticipated when tested in clinical trials, and failures are the rule rather than the exception.
If using AI in some capacity could slash costs, reduce the number of stumbles, or speed up the process, the cost savings could be tremendous. It's plausible that it'd lead to safer and more effective drugs, too.
But few big pharmas have the in-house technical know-how necessary to develop or implement such an AI system independently. Hence, Roche is teaming up with Nvidia, a leading AI company building a suite of services explicitly to help biopharma businesses operationalize AI.
With Nvidia's BioNeMo AI platform for drug development, customers can, among many other functions, predict how a given molecule or therapy candidate will interact with its intended physiological targets, paving the way for picking higher-quality leads to start working with in the laboratory. They can also train AI models to address their specific needs across most stages of the development process.
Roche isn't putting all its eggs in one basket when it comes to AI. It's also collaborating with Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a biotech focusing on using AI to empower drug development efforts, partially owned by Nvidia. In terms of how important the collaboration is, consider that Roche paid $150 million up front. It also committed to paying as much as $300 million in milestones and royalties for up to 40 different programs, making for a total potential consideration of more than $12 billion over the next 10 years or so.
Given that it currently has around $8 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on hand, it's reasonable to assume it's taking a bit of a shotgun approach to the programs it's working on with Recursion, with the expectation being that, ultimately, only a few of its attempts will be worth the full payment.
Recursion isn't Roche's only bet on scrappy young biotechs using AI, though. Since late 2020, it's been partnering with private biotech Genesis Therapeutics on unspecified programs, as well as others like Reverie Labs and Dyno Therapeutics. It also bought another company, Prescient Design, in 2021. With so many different attempts at generating some value from AI, it's quite likely the business will find a measure of success with at least one.
Wait for a firmer plan or actual results
In broad terms, it's a plus that Roche is making strides to optimize its drug development operations with AI. Securing collaborations with capstone players in AI, like Nvidia, is unambiguously positive and could indeed make Genentech a more efficient drugmaker in the short term. If, over the next couple of years, the company can advance more of its pre-clinical programs into clinical trials than before, it'll be evidence that AI is leading to higher productivity in a financially impactful way.
Management's alternative course of action -- waiting to dabble until the AI technology for drug development is proven useful -- would allow competitors uncontested access to this generation's most promising new digital toolset. Obviously, that doesn't sound like a good plan at all.
But as you may have noticed, there aren't too many clues as to which disease areas or biotechnologies will be the focus of its investments and partnerships in AI. So, there's little to reassure shareholders that resources are being allocated well.
In the near future, at least one big pharma player will very likely find a way to turn their use of AI into a competitive advantage. Presently, investors are mostly left with generalities and statements of broad ambitions from Roche's management rather than concrete roadmaps for how it will turn its use of AI into a durable driver of shareholder value. Until that changes, the best course of action is to hold off on buying (or selling) shares.

NVDA,2023-12-22 11:45:00,"Both of these companies are worth less than $1.2 billion, but they might not be for long.","The benchmark S&P 500 index is sitting on a gain of 24% this year (including dividends), which is way above its average of 13.7% over the last 10 years.
But most of this year's gains were delivered by a group of mega-cap technology stocks called the ""Magnificent Seven."" It includes Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms.
Together, they account for 28% of the value of the S&P 500. Therefore, the seven tech giants have a huge influence over the general direction of the market, and each of them has significantly outperformed this year -- Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta Platforms have each doubled.
Small caps have been left behind
The Russell 2000 index is a great barometer of performance for the smaller end of the market, because it's filled with stocks valued at less than $2 billion.
It delivered a return of just 13% in 2023 so it's underperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, and it actually spent several months trading in the red. High inflation and rising interest rates often hurt small companies the most because they need to access capital to grow. Giants like Apple and Microsoft have tens of billions in liquid cash at their disposal, so investors find safety in those names during economic turbulence instead.
Two stocks in the Russell 2000 are GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) and Lemonade (NYSE: LMND). Neither is very popular on Wall Street at the moment; they have attracted just one buy rating each, according to the analyst ratings tracked by The Wall Street Journal.
But they might not be neglected for much longer. I'm going to tell you why I think both stocks could soar in the new year.
1. GoPro: Unlocking new, high-margin revenue streams
Selling action cameras priced at $399 a pop isn't easy in a cost-of-living crisis where consumers are fighting rapid increases in food prices and mortgage repayments. As a result, investors shunned GoPro stock in 2023, sending it down 30%. But in my opinion, the company's valuation is borderline irresistible.
GoPro currently has a market capitalization of just $519 million, yet it's on track to deliver $1.04 billion in revenue this year so it's trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.5. It traded at a P/S ratio of 1.8 in 2021, so its stock would have to triple from here just to return to that level. It also traded at a P/S ratio above 4 shortly after it came public in 2014.
GoPro is expected to grow its revenue by just 8.6% in 2024, which is one of the main reasons for its tiny P/S ratio. But that isn't the whole story, because the company introduced lucrative subscription-based revenue streams that are growing significantly faster than its top line overall.
Its GoPro.com subscription is priced at $49.99 per year, and it gives customers exclusive product discounts, unlimited cloud storage for their videos, and livestream capabilities. As of the recent 2023 third quarter (ended Sept. 30), it had over 2.5 million subscribers, which was a 20% increase from the same time last year. That's enough to generate almost $125 million in annual recurring revenue, and since subscriptions don't carry high input costs, that revenue could have a gross profit margin of up to 80%.
GoPro is also planning to launch a Premium+ subscription priced at $99.99 per year, which will include access to advanced desktop-based content editing software. That means the company could unlock even more high-margin revenue in the new year.
As for GoPro's core business, it placed its action cameras in 2,500 new stores around the world this year and plans to add 3,000 more in 2024. That will take its total footprint to 25,000 stores globally, marking an increase of 30% since May this year. It sets the company up for a growth resurgence next year especially if economic conditions improve, so Wall Street might regret overlooking GoPro stock.
2. Lemonade: Primed for the artificial intelligence boom
Lemonade is an insurance provider with a twist. The company leans on artificial intelligence (AI) to handle everything from customer interactions to pricing premiums, and it's experiencing incredible success -- don't be fooled by its stock price, which is down 89% from its all-time high. Investors got a little carried away with the company's valuation during the tech frenzy of 2021, but it now trades at a far more reasonable level, which I think is attractive ahead of the new year.
Lemonade operates in five insurance markets: renters' insurance, homeowners' insurance, pet insurance, life insurance, and car insurance. Its AI chatbot, Maya, can be found on the Lemonade website, and it's the first point of contact for most potential customers. It can produce an insurance quote in just 90 seconds without any input from a company employee, according to the company.
Similarly, another bot called AI Jim can pay claims in under three minutes, also without human intervention on most occasions. This automated approach is far less frustrating than dealing with manual, slow claims processes at most traditional insurers, and it's proving incredibly popular. As of the recent 2023 third quarter (ended Sept. 30), Lemonade had almost 2 million customers, which is impressive given it only launched its first product in 2016.
Lemonade also uses AI extensively behind the scenes. Its Lifetime Value 6 (LTV6) model was released in 2022, and it was capable of predicting how likely a customer was to make a claim, how likely they were to buy multiple policies, and how likely they were to switch insurers. Those factors helped Lemonade price premiums as accurately as possible. But the company is now up to LTV8 and will soon launch LTV9, with each model more advanced than the last.
Lemonade offers customers everything they could want in an insurer: a fast signup process, a fast claims process, and accurate premiums, which can save them money in the long run.
Lemonade is on track to deliver $422 million in revenue in 2023, which will be a 64% increase compared to 2022. Yet the company is valued at just $1.2 billion, placing its stock at a price to sales ratio of just 2.6. That's near the cheapest valuation since Lemonade came public in 2020.
AI will likely remain a dominant market theme in 2024, and believe it or not, Lemonade is one of just a few companies successfully monetizing the technology. In my opinion, it won't be long before Wall Street and everyday investors latch onto this great opportunity.

NVDA,2023-12-22 11:52:00,EPS estimates show this company could double Nvidia's stock growth over the next two years.,"Excitement over artificial intelligence (AI) has created many millionaires this year, as chip stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have skyrocketed 230% since Jan. 1. The company has significantly profited from increased demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are crucial for training AI models.
Nvidia's business exploded this year. However, it is worth looking at companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI journeys, as they could have more room to run in the coming years.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is an exciting option, with years of experience in the chip market. The company also plans to launch a new AI GPU in 2024.
So, forget Nvidia. Here is why Intel is a magnificent AI stock to buy instead.
Intel is making moves to challenge Nvidia's dominance in 2024
It hasn't been easy to be an investor in Intel over the last few years. The company was responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market for at least a decade, and was the primary chip supplier for Apple's MacBook lineup for years. However, Intel's dominance saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to more innovative competitors.
As a result, Advanced Micro Devices started gradually eating away at Intel's CPU market share in 2017, with Intel's share now down to 69%. Then, in 2020, Apple cut ties with Intel in favor of far more powerful in-house hardware. Intel's stock subsequently dipped 4% over the last three years. Meanwhile, annual revenue tumbled 19%, with operating income down 90%.
However, the fall from grace has seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. According to Mercury Research, from the second quarter of 2022 to Q2 2023, Intel regained 3% of its CPU market share from AMD.
Moreover, Intel has pivoted its business to the $137 billion AI market, with plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in 2024. The sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it rise more than $1 trillion before the end of the decade.
As a result, even if Intel can't dethrone Nvidia, projections show there will be plenty of opportunities for Intel to snap up market share and profit significantly from the industry's development.
Earlier this month, Intel unveiled Gaudi3, a generative AI chip meant to compete directly with Nvidia's H100. The GPU will begin shipping in 2024 alongside Core Ultra and Xeon chips that include neural processing units, making them capable of running AI programs faster.
Shares in Intel have soared more than 70% in 2023, almost entirely thanks to its prospects in AI. While that is nowhere near Nvidia's stock growth in the period, it could mean Intel has more to offer new investors in the coming years.
More growth potential than Nvidia by far
The charts show Intel's earnings could hit nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's are expected to reach $24 per share. Therefore, on the surface, Nvidia might look like a no-brainer. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios yields a stock price of $130 for Intel and $939 for Nvidia.
Looking at their current positions, the figures project Intel's stock will rise 184% and Nvidia's 95% within the next two fiscal years. While both boast impressive growth, Intel is forecast to deliver far more significant gains.
The figures align with Nvidia's meteoric rise this year compared to Intel's more gradual expansion. Intel is just getting started in AI and could be in for a lucrative 2024. So if you're looking for an AI stock to add before the new year, Intel is a screaming buy right now instead of Nvidia.

NVDA,2023-12-22 13:30:00,These top growth stocks could help power your portfolio's performance in 2024 and beyond.,"With the S&P 500 now down just 1% from its record level, the benchmark index could be on the verge of reaching a new peak and ushering in the next sustained bull market.
But while the index has posted impressive gains across this year's trading and is teetering on entering a new bullish phase, the S&P 500's big rally this year has largely been driven by megacap tech stocks with premier positions in artificial intelligence -- such names as Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple.
But when the next bull market with legs hits, there's a good chance that high-quality stocks which still trade down big from previous highs will bounce back and deliver strong performance. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that investing in these top companies would be a great move now.
SoFi stock: Down 61% from its high
Jennifer Saibil: I was wary of the hype surrounding SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) when it went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in June of 2021. It was untested, with an astronomical valuation and no profits. I'm not surprised the stock fell off a cliff in the bear market.
Since then, however, several things have happened. Growth remains high, but the valuation has declined and profits are improving. And that's just the very top layer of the story.
SoFi's one-stop shop for digital financial services is resonating with its core customer base of students and young professionals. It acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp in 2022, and with it, a bank charter. It now offers a full suite of services like bank accounts and credit cards.
It's focused on providing an easy-to-use interface with low fees and high rates, and as members join and have a positive experience, they're adding more services. That's leading to scaling up without significant extra marketing costs and thus improved profitability.
In 2023's third quarter, revenue increased 27% year over year, a slowdown from previous quarters. But it added 717,000 new members, a 47% year-over-year increase (an acceleration) and more than 1 million new products.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 121% to $98 million. That's how SoFi has been measuring profitability, and it's important to watch the movement in this metric.
But it's also important to note progress in its path toward net profits, and how well it's generating cash. Its net loss actually ballooned in the quarter due to a goodwill impairment, but management reaffirmed that it will reach net profitability in the fourth quarter. As for cash, since SoFi now has deposits in addition to its original lending products segment, it has plenty of cash to run its business.
At the current price, the stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.6. While not objectively cheap, it's a valuation that takes SoFi's phenomenal growth into account. At this point in the story, SoFi has demonstrated that it can keep up the momentum in revenue while driving profitability.
It looks like we're right around the corner from a bull market, and SoFi is the kind of growth stock that thrives in positive market conditions. If it begins to report net profits, expect the stock to soar in 2024.
Airbnb stock: Down 32% from its high
Keith Noonan: While Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) stock has seen some volatile swings since going public in December 2020, the company has generally continued to post very encouraging business results. Revenue grew 18% year over year to reach $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and adjusted net income surged 33% to reach $1.6 billion and deliver a 47% net income margin.
Meanwhile, the business has now generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the trailing-12-month period, coming in at roughly 44% of total sales across the period. That's a fantastic margin, and it points to the potential for the stock to deliver impressive returns for investors who take a buy-and-hold approach at today's prices.
With a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion, Airbnb is valued at less than 23 times its trailing FCF. Given that the business is posting such strong margins and still growing revenue at a solid clip, the rental-platform leader's valuation continues to look attractive for long-term investors.
Airbnb's growth story is likely just getting started. Total active listings on the platform grew 19% year over year in the third quarter, and management continues to make smart moves to ensure that its platform is appealing to both property hosts and guests.
A growing number of listings on the platform should help ensure that a wide variety of offerings across a wide range of price points is available. Boosting active listings will likely also be a key catalyst in driving the work-anywhere, live-anywhere trend that remains an underappreciated contributor to the platform's long-term expansion potential.
With the stock still trading off 32% from the valuation peak that it reached in February 2021, Airbnb looks poised to deliver plenty of long-term upside and stands out as a smart buy for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.

NVDA,2023-12-26 19:25:25,"It was the year of artificial intelligence, and no Big Tech company leaned into the trend like Microsoft.","It was the year of artificial intelligence, and no Big Tech company leaned into the trend like Microsoft.
In 2023, the company’s CEO Satya Nadella made a multi-billion dollar investment in AI, commercialized and added AI tools like ChatGPT into its suite of products before rivals, and stunned industry onlookers with his ability to handle a crisis quickly, calmly and thoughtfully.
Under his leadership, the company is re-emerging as a tech innovator after years of riding the success of Windows. Wall Street has noticed, too: Microsoft’s stock is up 55% this year.
That’s why CNN Business’ staff chose Nadella as the CEO of the Year, beating out other contenders including Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
“There’s no question 2023 was the year of AI,” Nadella told CNN in an emailed response. “We’re no longer just talking about innovation in the abstract; we’re seeing real product-making, deployment and productivity gains. At the end of the day, though, this innovation will only be useful if it’s empowering all of us in our careers, in our communities, in our countries.”
Since 2018, the CNN Business’ team of writers and editors have met at the end of each year to select one person whose executive performance stood out. The process is admittedly subjective — we choose someone based on criteria that shifts year to year.
Maybe the company’s stock outperformed its rivals. Maybe the CEO righted the ship after a messy product launch or the company developed a lifesaving vaccine that altered the course of human history (tip of that hat to 2021’s CEO of the Year, Pfizer’s Albert Bourla).
This year’s CEO of the Year is once again a man, indicative of a larger representative problem in corporate America’s top positions. About 10% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies are women, according to Fortune. But our aim has never been to endorse any one executive over another. Rather, we hold a mirror up to the business world and tell a story about what we see. (We also considered non-CEO leaders, and chose Taylor Swift as our business leader of the year.)
For 2023, Nadella’s decisions have heavily impacted and influenced the direction of AI, the most significant innovation to come from Silicon Valley in decades.
As Gil Luria, a senior research analyst at wealth management firm DA Davidson, puts it: “His ability to steer the aircraft carrier that is Microsoft into this new era has been nothing short of remarkable.”
Changing the narrative
Nadella’s background doesn’t entirely fit the Ivy League dropout archetype of Silicon Valley. Born in India, Nadella came to the US in the late 1980s to pursue a master’s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, later receiving an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Nadella’s standout performance is a culmination of his work from prior years. He joined the company in 1992 as an engineer, at a time Microsoft was characterized by regulators as a monopoly.
When he was promoted to CEO nearly 10 years ago, Microsoft had developed a reputation for being slow to adapt to major trends, such as mobile. Fast forward to now and tech companies are lining up to partner with Microsoft and align with its mission to commercialize artificial intelligence for the masses.
In Nadella’s 2017 book, “Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone,” he wrote about his experience reworking everything internally, team by team and product by product, so Microsoft would be better set up for employees to collaborate with others.
He also worked to soften and revitalize Microsoft’s image. As far back as 2016, the company partnered with OpenAI — a then-emerging company with new AI tools — and allowed them to operate the technology on its Azure cloud servers in exchange for access to those tools.
But after a massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI earlier this year, following the viral launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Microsoft rolled out AI-powered versions of its flagship products, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, breathing new life into otherwise dulled software. Nadella’s push to commercialize these tools quickly gave it a head start against competitors such as Google and Amazon, who were working on similar technologies, and helped ignite an arms race across the industry.
Now as more companies, from Instacart to Snapchat, add ChatGPT and other OpenAI technologies to their own services, Microsoft’s cloud business is poised for deeper growth. Microsoft has reported strong Azure growth over the last three quarters.
Nadella’s remarkable moment
While Nadella had an impressive year across the board, his leadership shined even brighter during the string of events that followed the surprising ousting of OpenAI’s Altman, the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week.
The timing was noteworthy too: Just four days before, Nadella joined Altman on stage at OpenAI’s first developer conference to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and their partnership together.
The executives represented one of the most dynamic and key relationships in the tech industry, not only of the year but in years: Altman had clearly emerged as the face of the generative AI movement, and Nadella was one of the most powerful tech leaders funding the development of these tools.
“You guys have built something magical,” said Nadella at the time. “It’s been fantastic for us.”
But despite his long-standing relationship with OpenAI, Nadella reportedly found out about Altman’s removal from the company “just before” OpenAI released a statement, rendering Microsoft with no control over the situation.
The company in a statement said an internal investigation found that Altman was not always truthful with the board.
Microsoft’s stock sank in response, perhaps because OpenAI was to serve as a linchpin to their plans to expand AI across its products. “It was not a good look for Microsoft,” Luria said.
Nadella swiftly picked up the phone and offered to hire Altman at Microsoft to lead a new AI research lab, along with one of the co-founders, Greg Brockman, and any of the 700 Open AI employees who wanted to leave the company.
He also spoke to some OpenAI board members — the people who initially kept him out of the loop — and was able to get them on board with a solution that would be favorable to Microsoft, according to Luria.
Altman ultimately returned to OpenAI, with a new board intact.
“He turned what looked like a bad and embarrassing situation into a way to improve Microsoft’s standing with this very important partner,” Luria added. “What we saw from Mr. Nadella is an interpersonal skill you don’t always find with CEOs, who can be visionaries and luminaries and great at product, but aren’t necessarily able to pick up a phone, talk to people and get them to see things your way.”
As Fred Havemeyer, a senior enterprise software analyst at the Macquarie financial services firm, said in a letter to investors, “Mr. Nadella may have pulled off his own coup, acquiring the most important part of OpenAI — its ambitious talent.”
By Monday morning, Microsoft was in better shape than they were a week before. Its stock reached a record that day; shares rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44, beating the previous record of $376.17.
What’s ahead
According to Stuart Carlaw, chief research officer at ABI Research, Nadella’s successful year can be largely attributed to the fact that he’s remained extremely “focused.”
“His approach to the mechanics of leadership remains people driven,” Carlaw said. “He understands that people drive outcomes, and remained true to that ethic in the way he dealt with Sam Altman and the wider OpenAI team.”
Nadella also narrows in on where he wants to spend his energy. “He hasn’t been on a scattergun spree of investment ever since he took the reins,” Carlaw said. “He has been very focused on accretive areas that take the Microsoft brand forward.”
Takeshi Numoto, Microsoft’s chief marketing officer who has been employed in various roles at the company for 25 years, said he felt an internal culture shift this year, saying the company feels “fresh” and “energizing.”
“There is a sense that we are contributing to building the next wave of computing broadly for the world, and doing so thoughtfully,” he said.
Nadella told CNN he indeed remains “focused” on empowering both people and organizations to achieve more, as it continues to make and deploy new products.
“That’s our mission at Microsoft … and what we continue to focus on as we look to 2024 and beyond,” he said. “Just imagine if 8 billion people had access to a personalized tutor, a doctor that provided them medical guidance, a mentor that gave advice for anything they needed. I believe all that’s within reach. It’s about making the impossible possible.”
The biggest challenge, however, is if Nadella can take Microsoft to the next level by making these AI-powered products profitable.
“You are only as good as your last results release,” Carlaw said. “[But] he is not the only one facing this dilemma.”

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.
You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>
NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+246.0% vs. +151.2%). The company’s Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.
The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.
Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.
(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)
Shares of Oracle have gained +33.1% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +58.5%. The company is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings.
Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well. Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks.
Partnerships with VMWare and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele. ORCL is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.
However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion.
(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)
Shares of The TJX Companies have gained +18.0% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry’s gain of +19.2%. The company’s off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well.
The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The Marmaxx segment is doing well, where comparable store sales grew in the fiscal third quarter, backed by improved customer traffic. Strength at the company’s HomeGoods (U.S.) division bodes well. Also, it is boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives.
However, it has been grappling with high wage and supply-chain costs. It expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024. A high debt level poses a concern for the company. Currency fluctuations might act as a deterrent.

NVDA,2023-12-26 22:35:05,"Even after a recent rally, Nio stock is still down roughly 87% from its high.","Nio (NYSE: NIO) stock surged Tuesday. The Chinese electric vehicle (EV) specialist's share price ended the daily session up 10.8%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
On Dec. 23, the company revealed its ET9 ultra-luxury sedan at its Nio Day event. The company also took the wraps off its new, 5-nanometer (5nm) chip for autonomous driving. The U.S. market was closed for the Christmas holiday on Monday, but investors are showing their excitement for the new luxury vehicle and semiconductor technology today.
Nio's pipeline has investors feeling bullish
Starting at more than $112,000, Nio's ET9 sedan is poised to be the company's most expensive release to date. The EV will include a super-fast-charging battery pack and other high-end features, and represents a big push into the upper premium vehicle market. Deliveries for the ET9 are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2025.
The ET9 will also make use of Nio's first internally developed chip for partially autonomous driving. The Chinese company says that its 5nm chip for self-driving tech will be able to match the combined performance from four of Nvidia's industry-leading DRIVE Orin processors for autonomous navigation.
Is Nio stock a buy right now?
Despite the share price pop today, Nio stock is still down roughly 87% from its lifetime high. The EV specialist is now valued at less than 2.2 times the average analyst estimate for 2023 revenue -- a level that could be considered quite cheap given that the business is posting solid sales performance and has room for expansion in the Chinese market and internationally. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the business can deliver consistent profits.
Nio is a stock that could go on to deliver explosive gains for risk-tolerant investors, but it's also a potentially volatile play. In addition to uncertainty on the profitability front, the company's share price trajectory will likely continue to be shaped by the broader macroeconomic picture in China.
If you're willing to take on risk in pursuit of scoring big wins in the EV space, the stock could become a big winner. But you should weigh your tolerance for volatility before going all in on Nio.
